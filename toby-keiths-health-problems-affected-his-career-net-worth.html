He has been releasing songs since the early 1990s, starting with the single "Should've Been A Cowboy." In the past two years, the singer has been dealing with some tough times in his personal life that have changed his career.</p><p>Sometimes, celebrities decide to stay silent about health problems, but talking openly about struggles often makes stars more endearing and relatable to fans.</p><p>For instance, when <a href=#>Julia Louis-Dreyfus talked about having cancer</a>, her fans were heartbroken and hopeful that she would be okay. Toby Keith also decided to talk about his struggles publicly. Here's what fans should know about the singer's health and what happened to his music career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=toby-keith-39-s-health-issues-are-significant>Toby Keith's Health Issues Are Significant</h2><p>In June 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Toby Keith talked about having stomach cancer</a> in an Instagram post. According to Entertainment Weekly, he wrote, "Last fall I was diagnosed with stomach cancer. I’ve spent the last 6 months receiving chemo, radiation and surgery.</p><p>So far, so good.

This was definitely a big and exciting moment in his career. Since he was able to attend the event in person, this suggests that he has recovered quite a bit. Earlier on in his journey, it didn't seem like he would be able to go to an awards show.</p><p>According to Billboard, Keith was interviewed by Extra TV during the red carpet portion of the People's Choice Country Awards. He opened up about going through this awful struggle and said, “I’ve walked some dark hallways. Almighty’s riding shotgun. But I feel pretty good, you know?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/toby-keith-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keith continued, "You have good days and bad days. It’s a little bit of a roller coaster. I’m doing a lot better than I was this time last year... Just my faith. I’ve always rode with a prayer. As long as I have Him with me, I’m cool.

Since he found out that he had this condition in the fall of 2021 and then attended the People's Choice Country Awards in the fall of 2023, it seems like he took a step back for around two years.</p><p>It seems like because the singer learned what was going on, he was able to receive treatment. Unfortunately, this isn't the case all the time. According to The Mayo Clinic, people often learn that they have this health condition when their illness has reached a tough stage, and it can be difficult to get rid of the cancer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/toby-keith-1.jpg><p>The publication also notes that people can suffer from "metastatic stomach cancer," which means that other areas of the body are now being affected. According to E! News, Keith said that his tumor was a third smaller than it once was.</p><p>The singer put out album number 19, "Peso in My Pocket," in October 2021. Since he would have recorded and planned this album before he learned that he had stomach cancer, he was still able to share this new music with his fanbase.</p><h2 id=did-toby-keith-39-s-health-struggles-affect-his-net-worth>Did Toby Keith's Health Struggles Affect His Net Worth?</h2><p>While Toby Keith couldn't earn money from touring for the past two years and that meant missing out on some income, it's possible that might change soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In June 2023, according to People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keith wanted to go on tour again</a>. The singer was interviewed by The Oklahoman when he went to an event that supported the Toby Keith & Friends Golf Tournament.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/103369734_144766893878362_1720858443851039413_n.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Walker Hayes Almost Quit Country Music For This Relatable Reason</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Fancy Like launched Walker Hayes into TikTok notoriety, but he almost quit country music at the height of fame.</span><p>Keith explained, "I've got more wind.

He did follow his plan, though: in July 2023, he played two concerts at the Hollywood Corners venue in Norman, Oklahoma.</p><p>According to the singer's website, no official tour dates have been announced. Considering what he said, it's possible that Toby Keith is waiting to feel more energetic, and then he will book a tour.</p><p>Toby Keith's net worth is definitely high enough that it's possible to take a time out. According to Celebrity Net Worth, his net worth is $400 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/toby-keith-4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, the singer also has a group of restaurants called Toby Keith's I Love This Bar And Grill. It seems that this has given him another income stream while he has been recovering from stomach cancer.</p><p>There are two locations in Oklahoma that serve comfort food like burgers, fried bologna sandwiches, nachos, wings, and barbecue.</p><p>Back in 2011, Toby Keith was interviewed by The Country Daily and said that his tours have always been successful, no matter what. He explained that even when the economic situation isn't great, "It’s never affected us. You’re talking up or down 4 percent. It doesn’t fluctuate very much.”</p><p>It seems likely that when Toby Keith can tour again, he will continue to make a lot of money. He must miss touring, given how much he seemed to love it in the past. In 2009, he told The Boot that he wanted to make sure that fans liked his shows. He said, When we hit the stage at night, I've got 15 ballads I could play, but I'm not a balladeer. We're [here] to entertain. My shows are geared for these outdoor amphitheaters." He also said, "I want them to have so much fun, they hurt when they leave."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqJqpYrimtdOhqmaglZa5tbSMqamompyaurR5wJ%2BdnpukmrFutMisZJyZopqys3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftoby-keiths-health-problems-affected-his-career-net-worth.html&text=Toby%20Keith%27s%20Health%20Problems%20Affected%20His%20Career%20And%20Net%20Worth%20Forever&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftoby-keiths-health-problems-affected-his-career-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftoby-keiths-health-problems-affected-his-career-net-worth.html&title=Toby%20Keith%27s%20Health%20Problems%20Affected%20His%20Career%20And%20Net%20Worth%20Forever" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftoby-keiths-health-problems-affected-his-career-net-worth.html&title=Toby%20Keith%27s%20Health%20Problems%20Affected%20His%20Career%20And%20Net%20Worth%20Forever" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftoby-keiths-health-problems-affected-his-career-net-worth.html&title=Toby%20Keith%27s%20Health%20Problems%20Affected%20His%20Career%20And%20Net%20Worth%20Forever" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftoby-keiths-health-problems-affected-his-career-net-worth.html&description=Toby%20Keith%27s%20Health%20Problems%20Affected%20His%20Career%20And%20Net%20Worth%20Forever" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tony-orlando-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tony Orlando Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tiktok-what-is-hawks-real-name-legal-name-age-and-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tiktok: What Is Hawks Real Name?
