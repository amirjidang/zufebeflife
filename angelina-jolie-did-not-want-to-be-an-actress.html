In fact, it was her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who "thrust" a career in the entertainment industry upon her.</p><p>“My mom always wanted me to be an actor. And I started going to theater and going on auditions young. I only realized about five years ago that I actually didn’t want to be an actor. I’m a very private person. I don’t go out much. I’m home with kids. I go to work. I don’t really like being the focus of attention, which is why I like being behind the camera more,” Jolie revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bertrand, who died in 2007 at age 56 after a battle with ovarian cancer, gave up her dreams of being an actress herself to focus on motherhood. In a piece she wrote for <a href=#>The New York Times</a>, Jolie explained how her actor father Jon Voight's affair led to the breakdown of their family unit. "When my father had an affair, it changed her life. It set her dream of family life ablaze. But she still loved being a mother," Jolie penned.</p><p>"Her dreams of being an actor faded as she found herself, at the age of 26, raising two children with a famous ex who would cast a long shadow on her life," the Academy Award winner added. "After she died, I found a video of her acting in a short film. She was good. It was all possible for her."</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie-was-involved-in-public-triangle-with-brad-pitt-and-jennifer-aniston>Angelina Jolie Was Involved In Public Triangle With Brad Pitt And Jennifer Aniston</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite describing herself as a "private person. Angelina Jolie was involved in a very public scandal in 2005. The actress was accused of causing the divorce of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston in October 2005. Jolie admitted that she fell in love with Pitt during the filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith. But she vehemently denied allegations of an affair, saying, "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife." Neither Jolie nor Pitt would publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed they were expecting their first child together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During their 12-year relationship, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were dubbed "Brangelina" by the worldwide media. Their family grew to include six children, three of whom were adopted. Maddox, Pax, Zahara, who are adopted, and biological children Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne. The Hollywood golden couple announced their engagement in April 2012 and married on August 23, 2014, at their estate Château Miraval in Correns, France. Their children served as ring bearers at the wedding and helped illustrate Jolie's wedding dress with their drawings. But sadly after two years of marriage, the couple separated on September 15, 2016. Their divorce was finalized on April 12, 2019.</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie-revealed-she-had-a-gene-that-increased-her-risk-of-cancer>Angelina Jolie Revealed She Had A Gene That Increased Her Risk Of Cancer</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, Jolie won public support after she announced she had undergone a double mastectomy to reduce her chances of getting breast cancer. The Hollywood A-Lister was told by doctors that she had an 87 percent risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died of ovarian cancer, while her grandmother also died of the same type of cancer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Angelina Jolie And Johnny Depp Ever Actually Date?</a></span></p><p>Jolie wrote about the experience for the New York Times, bravely revealing that she made the choice to have surgery for her family.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Angelina Jolie Secretly Warned Johnny Depp About Marrying Amber Heard</a></span></p><p>"Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimise the risk as much I could," she said.
