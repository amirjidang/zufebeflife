He can boast an eclectic repertoire of films and has garnered considerable recognition with his roles in movies such as&nbsp;Boy Don't Cry, starring<a href=#> Hilary Swank</a>. Sarsgaard's decision to venture into writing and film was actually a secondary option, as he was initially focused on becoming a soccer player. He was unable to continue his pursuit in the sport due to concussions he incurred while playing. But despite not having the financial prowess of soccer players like <a href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, he can sit comfortably knowing that with a net worth of $25 million, he's richer than most people in America.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beginning-in-the-film-industry>Beginning In The Film Industry</h2><p>As any other famous Hollywood Elite actor, Peter Sarsgaard started out small in the film industry before working his way up to superstardom. After graduating from Washington University in Illinois in 1993, he moved to New York City where he landed guest roles in television crime dramas, such as Dick Wolf's Law and Order in 1995. Call it beginner's luck, but in the same year he entered the film industry, he displayed enough potential to land his movie debut in the crime drama, Dead Man Walking, starring Susan Sarandon and <a href=#>Sean Penn</a>. Sarsgaard's role was that of Walter Delacroix, one of the two teenagers killed by Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being fully emersed in his writing and film craft, he also appeared in his theatrical debut the same year in 1995 in an off-Broadway production of Laura Dennis, created by Albert Horton Foote Jr. He then starred beside <a href=#>Cynthia Nixon</a> from Sex and the City the following year in the play, Kingdom of Earth.&nbsp;Then in 1997, he did a stint in the TV police drama series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Undercover</a>. While his appearance in the single episode did not lead to continuous work, it was classed as an outstanding performance. Being a live stage theatrical performer, Peter was also cast in a few independent films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1998, he was featured in Another Day in Paradise, a crime drama about a teen junkie named Bobbie (<a href=#>Vincent Kartheiser</a>) who does petty crime to support his drug addiction and his girlfriend Rosie (Natasha Gregson Wagner). Also part of the cast were Academy-Award-winning celebrities James Wood and Melanie Griffith. However, the film flopped after grossing only $1 million on a $4.5 million budget. In the same year, he was featured in another indie film titled Desert Blue, starring names such as John Heard, Casey Affleck, <a href=#>Kate Hudson</a>, Christina Ricci, and Ethan Suplee.</p><p>Sarsgaard would have gained enough respect as a commanding actor to score bigger, higher-profile roles, such as The Man in The Iron Mask, where he played Raoul, the son of Athos (John Malkovich).&nbsp;It was also the highest-grossing movie of his career at the time, earning $183 million at the worldwide box office. A collection of actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio, John Malkovich, Gabriel Byrne, and Hugh Laurie made up the cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rising-in-rank>Rising In Rank</h2><p>Known for his gripping emotional conviction in performances, in 1999 Peter went on to star in the biographical film, Boys Don't Cry. Played by Hilary Swank, the film was based on real events surrounding the tragic life and death of a transgender man named Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered in 1993. Peter Sarsgaard acted as one of the main killers, John Lotter, while Brendan Sexton III played portrayed the second killer, Tom Nissen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brandon Teena was actually born as Teena Renae Brandon. He befriends Lotter and Nissen and later meets Candace (<a href=#>Lecy Goranson</a>) and Lana Tisdel (Chloe Sevigny), the latter of whom he becomes intimate. When hidden documents reveal his true identity, Brandon is gang-raped and later killed by the sociopathic John Lotter. The film was a massive success, grossing $20.7 million on a $2 million budget.&nbsp; The film also received two Golden Globe nominations while Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny won a Best Actress Oscar and Best Supporting Actress respectively. Sarsgaard was also praised for his depth of character in the performance.</p><p>By 2001, Sarsgaard had taken on his first leading role in the drama/romance, The Center of the World. The film centers on the life of a computer whiz, Richard Longman, who is embarking on million-dollar investment deals, but is depressed and feels the need for intimacy. To satisfy his desire, he pays a lap dancer named Florence (Molly Parker) $10,000 to spend three days in Las Vegas with him. He is heartbroken when he realizes there is no future with her and money can't buy love. <a href=#>Carla Gugino</a> also appears briefly as Florence's friend, Jerri. The film received mixed reviews, being compared to similar storylines like Pretty Woman. Albeit, it wasn't Sarsgaard's most stellar performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ups-and-downs-on-the-acting-journey>Ups And Downs On The Acting Journey</h2><p>The following year, Peter premiered in three movies simultaneously: K-19: The Widowmaker, Empire, and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Salton Sea</a>. Despite a great line-up of actors in K-19 The Widowmaker, such as Harison Ford and Liam Neeson, the film only made $65.7 million against a $90 million budget. The latter two films, which were lower-budget, fared much better at the box office. Empire was meant to be a grizzly <a href=#>gangster flick,</a> starring John Leguizamo, Denise Richards, and Fat Joe. Against a budget of $4 million, it grossed $18.5 million worldwide.&nbsp;The same can be said for The Salton Sea, in which Sarsgaard plays a meth-addicted police and FBI informant who is seeking revenge on the men who gunned down his wife. The Salton Sea grossed $18 million on a $1 million budget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, his movie resume has blossomed effervescently. He was cast alongside Zachary Braff in the 2004 comedy, Garden State, which grossed $35.8 million at the box office. In the same year, he starred opposite Liam Neeson in Kinsey, a biographical drama film about the life of biologist and sexologist, Alfred Charles Kinsey. The film grossed $16.9 million and also stars Laura Linney, <a href=#>Tim Curry</a>, and Oliver Platt.</p><h2 id=continued-growth-and-success>Continued Growth And Success</h2><p>His more recent film activity includes the 2009 psychological thriller, Orphan, in which Sarsgaard plays the role of John Coleman, the husband of Kate Coleman (<a href=#>Vera Farmiga</a>) and father of Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). The movie was a success and grossed $78.8 million worldwide. Then in 2010, he starred alongside Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise in Knight and Day, which grossed an awesome $262 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His other films include the superhero movie, Green Lantern starring Ryan Reynolds, where he portrayed the villain, Hector Hammond. The DC Entertainment production earned $219 million globally. Sarsgaard's latest film appearance was in the 2021 psychological drama, The Lost Daughter, starring Olivia Coleman, <a href=#>Ed Harris</a>, and Jessie Buckley.</p><p>Peter Sarsgaard has been married to Hollywood actress Maggie Gyllenhaal since 2002 and has birthed two daughters. In 2019, they sold their Brooklyn Townhouse for $4.6 million and, together, they are worth $50 million according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth.</a></p><p><span class=related-single><strong>REALTED: <a href=#>Million Dollar Curtain Calls: Braodways's Wealthiest Stars</a></strong></span></p><p><span class=next-single><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Highest-Grossing Ed Harris Movies</a></strong></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coming Soon</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Ebert</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbXSZqCsZaCawaa%2BjKyYq6uXlq6zsNJmpZ6sXay8s8DHZpisZZ%2BbenN8kWtm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthis-is-peter-sarsgaards-net-worth-as-of-2022.html&text=This%20Is%20Peter%20Sarsgaard%27s%20Net%20Worth%20As%20Of%202022&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthis-is-peter-sarsgaards-net-worth-as-of-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthis-is-peter-sarsgaards-net-worth-as-of-2022.html&title=This%20Is%20Peter%20Sarsgaard%27s%20Net%20Worth%20As%20Of%202022" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthis-is-peter-sarsgaards-net-worth-as-of-2022.html&title=This%20Is%20Peter%20Sarsgaard%27s%20Net%20Worth%20As%20Of%202022" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthis-is-peter-sarsgaards-net-worth-as-of-2022.html&title=This%20Is%20Peter%20Sarsgaard%27s%20Net%20Worth%20As%20Of%202022" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthis-is-peter-sarsgaards-net-worth-as-of-2022.html&description=This%20Is%20Peter%20Sarsgaard%27s%20Net%20Worth%20As%20Of%202022" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./top-10-best-places-to-eat-in-seoul.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 10 Best Places to Eat in Seoul ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./this-doctor-backed-sculpting-serum-is-only-35-at-amazon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Doctor-Backed Sculpting Serum Is Only $35 at Amazon">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
