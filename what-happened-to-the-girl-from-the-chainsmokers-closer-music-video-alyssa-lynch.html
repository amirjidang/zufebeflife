This includes just <a href=#>how big their net worth really is</a>. They may not even know if The Chainsmokers are even still together. But they do know that they had one of the biggest songs (if not THE biggest) of 2016. Not only did "Closer" become their first number-one single on The Billboard Hot 100 but it also helped to launch the incredible, and <a href=#>somewhat surprising, the career of Halsey</a>, who was featured on the song. At the time, it was also the only EDM song that made it to the top of The Billboard Hot 100 list. Since 2016, it has gone on to earn a diamond certification from the RIAA and is also seen as one of the most overplayed songs of all time. While this isn't a huge accomplishment, there's no doubt that it speaks to just how popular this song was at the time. Then there was the music video...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of this writing, the music video for "Closer" sits at over 2.7 billion... yes, with a "B"... views on YouTube. There's no doubt that the number exceeds that on non-official YouTube accounts as well as other venues. The video, which featured an extremely good-looking couple driving down the California coast became an instant hit. And yet with all the views and attention, we still don't really know who the stars of the video are. Most importantly, the girl from the video (who was easily the focus) has seemingly vanished into obscurity. Here's who that girl is and what actually happened to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-star-of-the-chainsmokers-quot-closer-quot-music-video-is-alyssa-lynch>The Star Of The Chainsmokers "Closer" Music Video Is Alyssa Lynch</h2><p>The Chainsmokers went for a gorgeous Canadian actor in Alyssa Lynch for their music video. But, in truth, Alyssa owes her major career break to her ex-boyfriend, Jordan Taylor Wright. This is because Jordan (the man co-starring in the "Closer" music video) is a famous videographer who has done work with <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> as well as The Chainsmokers. While he wasn't hired to direct the music video (that credit goes to Rory Kramer and Dano Cerny), <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordan was asked to be featured in it</a>. Not only that but an entire segment of his life was the star of "Closer". Of course, his girlfriend was asked to be the lead in the video alongside him and even their apartment was included. In many respects, one of the most popular music videos of all time is somebody's vlog.</p><p>This makes sense because Jordan and Alyssa spent much of their relationship filming absurdly gorgeous vlogs that showed off their lavish, extravagant, and alluring lifestyle. The vibe of the "Closer" music video very much reflects this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Billie Eilish & 9 Other Musicians Who Direct Their Own Music Videos</a></span></p><p>Even though Alyssa Lynch is best known for her influence status, both with Jordan Taylor Wright when they were together, to this day, she actually started as a model, singer, and actor. On top of this, the Vancouver-born actor was also a dancer when she was young. So, being in the public eye and the center of attention was clearly something that she wanted. And given the success of the music video, she got it... Momentarily, at least.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-alyssa-lynch-from-the-chainsmokers-39-music-video>What Happened To Alyssa Lynch From The Chainsmokers' Music Video?</h2><p>Prior to being cast alongside her boyfriend in the music video for "Closer", Alyssa Lynch starred on an episode of Supernatural and most famously played a younger version of Tiffani-Amber Thiessen in The Unauthorized Saved By The Bell Story. Given the pair's similar features, the casting was on-point. After "Closer", Alyssa played a small role in Before I Fall and did a bunch of episodes on Project Mc2, Mech-x4, and Travelers. But since then, the beautiful young woman has seemingly dropped off the face of the planet... At least to the mainstream, that is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alyssa still has a dedicated following who eagerly awaits <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her weekly vlog</a> where she details her life in Southern California with her new boyfriend, Justin. Additionally, fans get to learn about her beauty tips, fitness regime, diet, general style, and, well.... all that typical Youtube influencer stuff. Alyssa also runs her own workout classes online. Frankly, there doesn't seem to be much she doesn't do. Not only does this keep her busy and healthy but it keeps her fans entertained.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How A Music Video Saved 'Degrassi: The Next Generation' From Cancelation</a></span></p><p>On top of this, Alyssa is also still a working model.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only do publications see the value in putting Alyssa front and center due to her beauty, but because of her smartly curated vlogs and honesty with her fans, she has built a fanbase who are happy to follow her past her star-making turn in The Chainsmokers' "Closer" music video.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Halsey Explains To Enraged Fans That They Skipped Met Gala Due To Postpartum Complications</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bsDHnmSgoaKheqe%2BzqZkraCVYrCprcinqqanm5q%2FtHnCpaasnaJiura%2FyJxkr6GUmrxurcuyqqyZXaHGr6%2FHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-girl-from-the-chainsmokers-closer-music-video-alyssa-lynch.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Girl%20From%20The%20Chainsmokers%27%20%27Closer%27%20Music%20Video%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-girl-from-the-chainsmokers-closer-music-video-alyssa-lynch.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-girl-from-the-chainsmokers-closer-music-video-alyssa-lynch.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Girl%20From%20The%20Chainsmokers%27%20%27Closer%27%20Music%20Video%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-girl-from-the-chainsmokers-closer-music-video-alyssa-lynch.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Girl%20From%20The%20Chainsmokers%27%20%27Closer%27%20Music%20Video%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-girl-from-the-chainsmokers-closer-music-video-alyssa-lynch.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Girl%20From%20The%20Chainsmokers%27%20%27Closer%27%20Music%20Video%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-the-girl-from-the-chainsmokers-closer-music-video-alyssa-lynch.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Girl%20From%20The%20Chainsmokers%27%20%27Closer%27%20Music%20Video%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-ghazal-alagh-religion-details-to-know-about-the-entrepreneur-232748-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Ghazal Alagh Religion?
