This was the decade that boasted shows like <a href=#>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a> and <a href=#>Full House</a>, which is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Frasier</a> is one of the greatest shows from the decade, and its cast was nothing short of brilliant in each episode. A lot has changed since the show's end in 2004, and one primary cast member looks a lot different these days.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at the success of Frasier and see which cast member has changed through the years.</p><h2 id=39-frasier-39-was-a-smash-hit>'Frasier' Was A Smash Hit</h2><p>In a decade that featured massively popular sitcoms like Seinfeld and Friends, a little show called Frasier still managed to become one of the biggest and best of the entire decade. It may have started out as a spin-off project, but over time, it took on its own identity and forged a lasting legacy on television.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring Kelsey Grammer, Frasier was more than fans of Cheers could have hoped for. It was able to do its own thing away from the Cheers world and really take fans into the lead character's life up in Seattle.</p><p>For 264 episodes, the series was able to thrive on the small screen, and next year, a revival will be hitting Paramount+. There is a lot of hype behind it, and it will be fascinating to see how it holds up after all these years.</p><p>One of the best elements of the show was its cast, and it just so happens that David Hyde Pierce was one of the key pieces of the puzzle.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s Why Lisa Kudrow Was Fired From ‘Frasier’… And How She Got ‘Friends’ The Same Year</a></span></p><h2 id=david-hyde-pierce-starred-on-39-frasier-39>David Hyde Pierce Starred On 'Frasier'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From 1993 to 2004, David Hyde Pierce played Dr. Niles Crane on Frasier to perfection, and to say that he was loved by the fans would be a major understatement. Frasier might have been the star of the show, but Perce's Niles was a major reason that fans kept coming back for more.</p><p>At first, Hyde had some serious <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">problems with the script</a>, namely the way that his character was written.</p><p>"When I got the script, I read it and thought, 'This is terrible,'" he said.</p><p>However, things were eventually whipped into shape, and he wound up taking on the role that would have a huge hand in making him one of the most popular television performers of the 90s. More than 200 episodes later, and Hyde was a permanent piece of television history.</p><p>Hyde's popularity grew rapidly thanks to the show's success, but he was not always comfortable with the attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When talking about the fame, he said, "It’s not something I’d ever been interested in or sought out."</p><p>It has been 17 years since the show went off the air, and it's safe to say that a lot has changed for David Hyde Pierce in the years since.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Much 'Eddie' The Jack Russell Terrier On 'Frasier' Was Paid</a></span></p><h2 id=what-david-hyde-pierce-looks-like-now>What David Hyde Pierce Looks Like Now</h2><p>These days, David Hyde Pierce still looks great, and the actor has been quite busy with a number of different endeavors. Frasier might always be what he is known best for, but the truth of the matter is that he has had a wonderful career in entertainment and has done everything in his power to leave an impact outside of it, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One major contribution that Pierce has made has been in the world of Alzheimer's, where he has been a spokesperson and an advocate. The disease hits close to home for the actor, and he has helped raise awareness.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a speech</a>, he said, "Ultimately, though, it is up to us, to all of us, to the American people and to their representatives about whether we face the challenges and make all the effort necessary or if we ignore it and just let this sort of tidal wave crash over us."</p><p>The actor has continued performing on stage and in more traditional projects, as well. Some of his most recent credits include The Good Wife, two Wet Hot American Summer projects, and When We Rise. In 2021, he was playing Walter in the stage production The Visitor, which fans were excited to see.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Kelsey Grammar Actually Get Along With His 'Frasier' Co-Stars?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's pretty remarkable to see what David Hyde Pierce has been up to long after his days on Frasier came to an end. He has changed in a number of ways, and he continues to make a positive impact on those around him.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans Think 'Frasier's' David Hyde Pierce Quit Hollywood, Here's Why</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXqpxcOeZKmhlaewpnnFq5isnaJiwq%2B%2BxJymoKaZr66juMRmq6icka56tb7Ap6qfp6KirrW1zqdksKCVp7JurdGeZK2gla56r7vWZqmemp%2BkwXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-hyde-pierce-fraser-unrecognizable-today-transformation-where-are-they-now-reboot.html&text=This%20%27Frasier%27%20Cast%20Member%20Looks%20Unrecognizable%20Today&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-hyde-pierce-fraser-unrecognizable-today-transformation-where-are-they-now-reboot.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-hyde-pierce-fraser-unrecognizable-today-transformation-where-are-they-now-reboot.html&title=This%20%27Frasier%27%20Cast%20Member%20Looks%20Unrecognizable%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-hyde-pierce-fraser-unrecognizable-today-transformation-where-are-they-now-reboot.html&title=This%20%27Frasier%27%20Cast%20Member%20Looks%20Unrecognizable%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-hyde-pierce-fraser-unrecognizable-today-transformation-where-are-they-now-reboot.html&title=This%20%27Frasier%27%20Cast%20Member%20Looks%20Unrecognizable%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-hyde-pierce-fraser-unrecognizable-today-transformation-where-are-they-now-reboot.html&description=This%20%27Frasier%27%20Cast%20Member%20Looks%20Unrecognizable%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tristan-hemsworth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tristan Hemsworth (Chris Hemsworths Son) Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./camila-cabello-earns-spends-millions.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Ways Camila Cabello Earns And Spends Her Millions">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
