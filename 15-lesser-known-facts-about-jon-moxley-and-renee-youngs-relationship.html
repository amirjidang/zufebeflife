The two kept pretty quiet about their relationship until going public, and many would say, of all the couples in WWE, they were the oddest ones. Renee seems so bubbly and energetic, while Ambrose has this laid-back personality. Perhaps it’s a matter of opposites attract.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not much is known about the relationship, and even more now than&nbsp;Moxley has gone to AEW and Renee is still in WWE. They don’t talk about it or even acknowledge the relationship on either program, although Renee was asked on WWE Backstage who her favorite member of the Shield was and she blushed as she tried to avoid the question. As Moxley prepares for a battle at AEW, he’s some information about his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE WAG</a> Renee Young and his relationship during the time they spent together in WWE.</p><h2 id=went-public-in-2015><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Went Public in 2015</span></h2><p>Renee and Dean tried to keep their relationship private for the longest time, but finally, they came out as a couple in March 2015. Renee was the one who put it out on social media after the couple was spotted traveling together and eating together for a while before they made it official.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=split-during-the-draft><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Split During The Draft</span></h2><p>A struggle early on was when the WWE draft happened and Ambrose, who was WWE Champion, went to Smackdown. Renee was the backstage interviewer on RAW and announcers weren’t drafted, so she stayed and Ambrose went to Smackdown. It wasn’t until she started hosting Talking Smack did they reunite.</p><h2 id=ambrose-hated-total-divas><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Ambrose Hated Total Divas</span></h2><p>Renee was featured on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Total Divas</a> and that meant, Dean had to be on the show as well. Dean hated being in front of the camera and on reality television, which caused some weird moments on the show, as Dean appeared to be just goofing off. But he did it anyway because it was important to Renee.</p><h2 id=had-to-battle-internet-trolls><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Had To Battle Internet Trolls</span></h2><p>When they did come out as a couple, Renee had to battle a lot of internet trolls, specifically Ambrose fan girls on social media. Since Dean didn’t have social media, she went it alone, even getting help from other Divas like Summer Rae to battle the trolls off. It was a lot of abuse, considering Ambrose was the one who went after Renee.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">17 AEW Stars And Their Real-Life Relationships Behind The Scenes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=deanne><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>#Deanne</span></h2><p>Every celebrity couple seems to get a nickname. Think of Bennifer, Brangelina, and Kimye are some of the famous ones, and for a time, Deanne was trending because of Dean and Renee. Considering Deanne is a real name, it seems kind of odd really and doesn’t have the same ring as the other celeb names.</p><h2 id=most-beautiful-girl-in-the-world><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Most Beautiful Girl In The World</span></h2><p>Six months after they went public, Dean was asked by the Sun in Britain about dating Renee and he said Renee was the most beautiful girl in the world. That’s high praise coming from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dean Ambrose</a> and not what fans expected. Plus he said, he has very high standards for who he dates, and anything less than optimal wouldn’t be acceptable.</p><h2 id=try-to-stay-private><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Try To Stay Private</span></h2><p>One thing the couple tries to do is stay as private as they can. Not a lot of information is out there about them. Dean Ambrose didn’t have social media for the longest time, and Renee only showed photos on her Instagram from time to time. Being private is what made their relationship work, as it kept them out of the public eye.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=love-at-first-sight><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Love At First Sight</span></h2><p>It was Dean that showed interest first in Renee, and very quickly as well, as he had only been with WWE for six months when they started dating. Renee said it was Dean who was being flirty and the other women in the locker room had to tell her that Dean was interested in her. Renee just thought he had a thing for Canadian girls.</p><h2 id=the-miz-brought-it-to-storyline><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Miz Brought It To Storyline</span></h2><p>While they let the cat out of the bag in 2015, it wasn’t until 2016 when it made it to storyline. And that’s because of the Miz, who in December 2016 called out Renee in an interview, in which Renee said he was obsessed with Dean Ambrose. Mix fired back, “You’re the one sleeping with him!”, which resulted in a slap to the face.</p><h2 id=a-different-person><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>A Different Person</span></h2><p>Behind the scenes of even Total Divas, Renee says Dean is a very different person. On camera, he’s putting on a show, but behind the scenes, he’s calm, relaxed and very loving towards his wife. Renee actually said he was adorable at home, which is a far cry from the ‘lunatic fringe’ on TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=too-good-for-him><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Too Good For Him</span></h2><p>Dean knows when he has a good thing and said in an interview that Renee was too good for him. But he did add that he has her claws in her now and she can’t sneak away. Isn’t that the kind of relationship every woman wants, where the man realizes she is too good and has options, but stays with him anyway?</p><h2 id=renee-moved-from-new-york-to-vegas><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Renee Moved From New York To Vegas</span></h2><p>When they got married, obviously living together came up. Renee was living in New York City and loved the busy life. Dean was in Las Vegas, and while the strip may be party central, Vegas itself is pretty calm and remote. It fit his lifestyle perfectly and Renee admitted on a podcast that it was hard adjusting to the quiet life.</p><h2 id=renee-s-family-loves-dean><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Renee’s Family Loves Dean</span></h2><p>Dean did the smart thing and got her family on his side. Renee’s mother came to his defence on an episode of Total Divas, and eventually said her daughter could never find a better guy than Dean. He even chased down a man who stole Renee’s purse when her parents were around. Now that’s how you keep the parents happy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wrestlemania-33-plans><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>WrestleMania 33 Plans?</span></h2><p>At WrestleMania 33, The Miz and Maryse teamed up to face John Cena and Nikki Bella. But it appears plans were in the works for it to be Dean and Renee as their opponents. For a few weeks, Maryse even got into it with Renee and got a slap across the face, but plans were dropped and Cena and Bella were put in their place.</p><h2 id=sporting-rings-on-wwe-tv><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sporting Rings on WWE TV</span></h2><p>Renee and Dean tried to keep their marriage a secret but it lasted only two days. When Dean showed up to RAW, he was wearing his wedding ring on television and people spotted in. Similarly, Renee was on Smackdown and she was sporting her ring as well. It didn’t take long for fans to put two and two together.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Things No One Knows About These Wrestlers' WAGs</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobmWcmsC0sdFmoqenp6N6p63CrapmmZKkwrV5yailZqWfrbmmxYyapZ1lopq7prGMsqauppeoerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-lesser-known-facts-about-jon-moxley-and-renee-youngs-relationship.html&text=15%20Lesser%20Known%20Facts%20About%20Jon%20Moxley%20And%20Renee%20Young%27s%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-lesser-known-facts-about-jon-moxley-and-renee-youngs-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-lesser-known-facts-about-jon-moxley-and-renee-youngs-relationship.html&title=15%20Lesser%20Known%20Facts%20About%20Jon%20Moxley%20And%20Renee%20Young%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-lesser-known-facts-about-jon-moxley-and-renee-youngs-relationship.html&title=15%20Lesser%20Known%20Facts%20About%20Jon%20Moxley%20And%20Renee%20Young%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-lesser-known-facts-about-jon-moxley-and-renee-youngs-relationship.html&title=15%20Lesser%20Known%20Facts%20About%20Jon%20Moxley%20And%20Renee%20Young%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-lesser-known-facts-about-jon-moxley-and-renee-youngs-relationship.html&description=15%20Lesser%20Known%20Facts%20About%20Jon%20Moxley%20And%20Renee%20Young%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./9-ways-the-mysterious-sia-furler-earned-30-million.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="9 Ways The Mysterious Sia Furler Earned $30 Million">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-of-the-youngest-celebrities-to-get-plastic-surgery.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Of The Youngest Celebrities To Get Plastic Surgery">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
