Nick Robinson has been dating Samantha Urbani for just over two years. Let's take a look at what we know about the actor's girlfriend.</p><h2 id=a-musician>A Musician</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Some famous couples stay private</a>&nbsp;and the same can be said of Nick Robinson and Samantha Urbani. While she has posted some photos of him on her Instagram account, there don't seem to be any couple selfies on his social media.</p><p>Nick Robinson and Samantha Urbani <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began their romance in April 2019</a>, according to Your Tango.</p><p>Urbani is a singer who was in the band Friends and has also released music on her own.<strong></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Urbani's solo EP is called Policies of Power</a>&nbsp;and, according to&nbsp;Fader.com, she left Friends in 2015 and began living in L.A. In an interview with the publication, Urbani shared more about the experience of being part of a band and then going solo.</p><p>Urbani said, "I started this band [Friends] and it sort of accidentally became a buzz band and I had a lot of internal crisis about whether I wanted to do anything that was popular or visible because on some level it taints making things and it's organic and compulsive in some natural way. Even though I missed playing shows and being in a community, I got back to a pretty zen place of writing song and not being visible."</p><p>In an interview with&nbsp;Paper Magazine, Urbani talked about how when Friends started in 2010, she didn't have an Instagram account, and so the world is definitely different now. She explained her POV and said, "I think it's easy for the actual music to be overlooked in favor of an artist's aesthetic."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Forgotten Facts About Dave Navarro And Carmen Electra’s Relationship</a></span></p><p>Samantha Urbani has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoken about writing songs on her own and in a band</a> and in an interview with&nbsp;High Snobiety, she said that sometimes some people in the group can adore a song when others don't at all. She explained, "When you have a band, there’s a system of checks and balances at play. One person loves one song and you make fun of them for it because you think it’s the worst. But if you’re just having an internal dialogue with yourself, you question the music a lot. There’s definitely less of an ongoing catharsis with dialogue I think."</p><p>Urbani said that she recorded her EP in Los Angeles and in the interview, she explained that when she moved to the city, she was with her ex-boyfriend. He told her that he was going to NYC for a week and then he never ended up returning at all. She said it was a time of "bad communication" and it sounds like it was also tough as she and her ex-boyfriend were planning on making music together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Christina Milian Has Done Since The Early 2000s</a></span></p><p>There isn't a lot out there about Nick Robinson and Samantha Urbani's relationship. According to Distractify.com, he doesn't usually talk about anyone who is dating. Fans think that he dated Taylor Spreitler, who he starred on Melissa & Joey with, as well as Chloe Grace Moretz, but no one is sure if that is true.</p><p>Robinson&nbsp;explained on the podcast "The Big Ticket," which is put out by iHeart and Variety, that he and Urbani contracted COVID-19. This happened in March 2020 while they were in NYC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;The Daily Mail, he said, "We both got sick.&nbsp;Luckily, it was very mild. We had some fevers and we lost our senses of taste and smell. But after that we had tested positive for antibodies, but there are questions about how long that lasts."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Ariana Grande Managed To Keep Her Wedding A Secret</a></span></p><p>While&nbsp;A Teacher&nbsp;has been controversial, Robinson was interested in the project and, according to&nbsp;Variety.com, thought&nbsp;the material was great and that it made sense to play another teenager.&nbsp;Robinson said, "And I was compelled enough to go back to high school yet again, do another tour. This show was talking about these kinds of relationships in a way that was a little more nuanced and detailed than I had seen in the past that seemed to clickbait headlines."</p><p>Robinson and Urbani are definitely a super creative couple. Robinson's next project is&nbsp;Maid, a Netflix show based on the&nbsp;memoir by Stephanie Land, and it seems likely that Urbani will continue to release music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which Of Her Exes Does Taylor Swift Still Stay In Contact With?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilopubYr%2BwrsinqqimXZy2s7jFq6CeppRiwKK5wKeroZldqr%2Bjrc2iZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnick-robinson-girlfriend-samantha-urbani.html&text=Who%20Is%20Nick%20Robinsons%20Girlfriend%20Samantha%20Urbani%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnick-robinson-girlfriend-samantha-urbani.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnick-robinson-girlfriend-samantha-urbani.html&title=Who%20Is%20Nick%20Robinsons%20Girlfriend%20Samantha%20Urbani%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnick-robinson-girlfriend-samantha-urbani.html&title=Who%20Is%20Nick%20Robinsons%20Girlfriend%20Samantha%20Urbani%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnick-robinson-girlfriend-samantha-urbani.html&title=Who%20Is%20Nick%20Robinsons%20Girlfriend%20Samantha%20Urbani%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnick-robinson-girlfriend-samantha-urbani.html&description=Who%20Is%20Nick%20Robinsons%20Girlfriend%20Samantha%20Urbani%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-did-gloom-quit-youtube-525776-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Did Gloom Quit YouTube?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-lil-tay-parents-brother-sister-age-net-worth-ethnicity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Lil Tay?
