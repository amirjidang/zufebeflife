Sure, we still have some talented artists out there; however, the charts seem to be filled with catchy singles that are stuck on repeat. You use to be able to go buy an album and listen to it all the way through, without feeling the need to skip through half the tracks. It seems as if a majority of today’s musicians only care about making a quick buck, rather than producing a well composed assortment of songs. A real artist puts everything he or she has into their music, not just a couple ounces of their true potential.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another huge problem with today’s artists are their attitudes; especially towards their fans. Now, when you’re in the music industry besides your music itself, your fans are the most important commodity, no? Well, it doesn’t seem to be that way anymore, at least not for a few egotistical artists that is. Unfortunately, simply showing respect and appreciation for your fans has become a sort of manipulated façade which is manufactured by the media to convince unknowing fans. This alone is enough to frustrate and baffle those who see past the deception. As much as some may want to deny the facts, the harsh truth is that many of today’s superstars are not only overrated, but are also ungrateful self-centred narcissists. So without further ado, here are 10 overrated artists who don’t deserve their fame:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-fetty-wap><strong>10. Fetty Wap</strong></h2><p>Ok first off we have “Fetty Wap,” which sounds like something a mumbling three year old would say, regardless of the slang infused meaning behind the name (it still sounds stupid). This guy is the perfect example of a stereotypical rapper. All he talks about is his yearning to sleep with girls, how much money he has and his love for getting intoxicated. This whole image has been overdone for years now and it’s baffling to think people still deem this as “cool.” Yet there are still enough people who enjoy this so called music, so unfortunately more and more of these auto-tuned rapper/hip hop artists will continue to take advantage of the musically impaired.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-chris-brown><strong>9. Chris Brown</strong></h2><p>Sure, the guy can dance there’s no argument there, but let’s be honest - he’s not the greatest singer. If you disagree just ask yourself one question; why dose he lip sync during his live performances? And let’s not pretend that beating <a href=#>Rihanna</a> to the point where she had to be hospitalized didn’t help with his record sales (as ridiculous as this may sound it’s like they say, all press is good press). So if putting out mediocre hip hop songs and beating up women is what it takes to become a hip hop star, there's no hope in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-miley-cyrus><strong>8. Miley Cyrus</strong></h2><p>If you have to resort to parading yourself around practically nude just so people will talk about you, clearly your music and or brain is lacking something…talent. Even in <a href=#>Miley</a>’s good-girl Disney days, she still wasn’t very impressive. Her acting was cheesy at best and&nbsp;her singing was never amazing, regardless of what you may think. We’re not saying she can’t sing, but she’s no <a href=#>Adele</a>. If she had that much talent there would be no need for the ridiculously designed attire and sudden love for narcotics, twerking and partying. Miley got scared because she realized her fame was dwindling, so she went a little crazy and created this new image for herself.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-katy-perry><strong>7. Katy Perry</strong></h2><p>Were just going to come out and say it - <a href=#>Katy Perry</a> is a mediocre singer at best. It’s no secret that she lip syncs at live shows. If she could sing as well as her studio voice, why would she lip sync in the first place? It’s no big surprise, most pop stars lip sync their songs, but there’s another factor that results in Perry being overrated; she doesn’t write her own songs. Although this might not be a big deal for some people, it’s completely unfair to give Perry or any other such praise and credit as a musical artist while the real writers get left behind in the background. This may seem harsh, but it’s the truth.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-silento><strong>6. Silento</strong></h2><p>It’s difficult to even wrap your head around the idea of intentionally listening to his arrangement of noises. Seriously, he sounds like a drunken parrot who stumbled into a recording studio and started pushing buttons. If repetitive lyrics which consist of both broken English and make-believe words interest you, Silento may just be the next artist who will gladly make your ears bleed. His godawful song “Watch Me” somehow made number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. This is truly baffling; the song literally consists of Silento repeating himself over and over saying things like: “Ooh watch me, watch me,” “Do the stanky leg,” and of course “Now watch me whip, watch me nae nae” - along with a bunch of other nonsensical slang. Sorry if reading this alone gave you a headache... hopefully Silento’s speech impediment will worsen rendering him incapable of releasing any further music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-iggy-azalea><strong>5. Iggy Azalea</strong></h2><p>Thanks to the current obsession with oversized backsides, <a href=#>Iggy Azalea</a> has managed to make quite a bit of money over the past few years. Her hit song "Fancy" is responsible for most of her fame, yet there has been a lot of speculation behind who really wrote the song. Regardless of the facts, the song is catchy at best; it’s no masterpiece and will surely be forgotten in the next few years along with Iggy herself. She’s no singer that’s for sure, and if she doesn’t even write her own rhymes her five minutes of fame is already counting down.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-nicki-minaj><strong>4. Nicki Minaj</strong></h2><p>Speaking of big butts here, we have another overrated rapper who’s known for exploiting their assets. Though she does have some skills when it comes to rapping, her lyrics fall into the category of overused vulgar ranting. Not to mention her song "Anaconda" was a cheap rip-off <a href=#>Sir-Mix-a-Lot</a>’s "Baby Got Back." It’s hard not to credit the doctors who designed her body as being responsible for her fame. It seems these days, paying for excessive amounts of silicone is your best bet if you want to get signed by a record label. Regardless of what <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> might tell herself, her new busty frame has a lot more to do with her success than she thinks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-drake><strong>3. Drake</strong></h2><p>Hey, look that kid from Degrassi can walk now, and he’s trying to rap! Just because a lot of rich teenage white kids like to spend their parent’s money on <a href=#>Drake</a>’s music, it doesn’t mean he’s any good. Seriously, why does he sound so miserable? Maybe he’s still upset because his dance moves make everyone around him uncomfortable, but let’s get back to the vocals. There seems to be this obsession with slurring your words together in rap and hip-hop these days. Not only does it sound stupid, but it’s nearly imposable to make any sense out of what these rappers are saying.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-justin-bieber><strong>2. Justin Bieber</strong></h2><p>It would be unfair to say this kid has no talent whatsoever - he’s an all right singer and he can play a few chords on the guitar, but he’s no super talent. Sure, he may write his own songs, but lyrically they sound like something a 13&nbsp;year old would write down after a breakup. The main problem with <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> is his attitude, especially towards his fans. Not only has he walked off stage because of some spilt water, but this spoiled little brat has even spat on his own fans! This display of disrespect is pitiful. Bieber’s lucky his poor character and lack of respect hasn’t ended his career.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-kanye-west><strong>1. Kanye West</strong></h2><p>Ok, so <a href=#>Kanye West</a>'s first few albums weren’t that bad, but then something happened...he turned into the world's biggest narcissist. It’s almost as if he became so infatuated with himself that he lost the ability to differentiate his good ideas from the bad ones. Whatever popped into Kanye’s head was gold, at least to him that is. Take his clothing line for example; who wants to spend $500 on a shirt that looks like it was worn by a pleb in the 1700s? This guy should win a medal for his ability to rant about almost anything, even if he has no idea what he’s talking about. This egocentric rapper has had the audacity to compare himself to people like Pablo Picasso, <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>, <a href=#>Jimi Hendrix</a> and even Shakespeare. Shakespeare, really!? Clearly, this guy is insane. Nobody is a bigger fan of Kanye West than Kanye West, and that will never change.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources: <a href=#>Wikipedia</a>, <a href=#>Billboard</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2qu7Wty56lrZ2UYq6zwMisq6xlp528brDOp6tmnJWosrPCxGaroZ2Zp3qnrcyeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-untalented-artists-who-dont-deserve-their-fame.html&text=10%20Untalented%20Artists%20Who%20Don%27t%20Deserve%20Their%20Fame&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-untalented-artists-who-dont-deserve-their-fame.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-untalented-artists-who-dont-deserve-their-fame.html&title=10%20Untalented%20Artists%20Who%20Don%27t%20Deserve%20Their%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-untalented-artists-who-dont-deserve-their-fame.html&title=10%20Untalented%20Artists%20Who%20Don%27t%20Deserve%20Their%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-untalented-artists-who-dont-deserve-their-fame.html&title=10%20Untalented%20Artists%20Who%20Don%27t%20Deserve%20Their%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-untalented-artists-who-dont-deserve-their-fame.html&description=10%20Untalented%20Artists%20Who%20Don%27t%20Deserve%20Their%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-times-wrestlers-were-arrested-but-the-charges-were-dropped.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Times Wrestlers Were Arrested...But The Charges Were Dropped">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./celebrity-backyards-beautiful-rich.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Stunning Celebrity Backyards (That Are One Of A Kind)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
