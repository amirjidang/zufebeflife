However, viewers were delighted to learn <a href=#>at the reunion</a>, despite not saying their “I do’s,” the couple chose to continue their relationship off-screen since November 2021, and seemed happier than ever.But as these things go, until the big reveal, the pair had to keep their relationship under wraps, which led to people assuming SK was single. At the reunion, Raven revealed how SK would show her the salacious DMs he would receive, to which Raven cheekily responded, “Stay out of my man’s DMs,” and reaffirmed the relationship.Unfortunately, soon after, two women came forward in the since-deleted TikToks accusing SK of not behaving as a loyal boyfriend, err, fiancé (?) should, and they seemingly had the receipts to prove it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sk-allegedly-hit-up-his-exes-once-filming-ended>SK Allegedly Hit Up His Exes Once Filming Ended</h2><p>Filming was said to have concluded <a href=#>in July 2021</a>. In the viral videos damning SK’s behavior, the women claimed he reached out to hang out soon after and <a href=#>had even invited one of them on a trip to Ibiza</a>. Since SK and Raven had to keep their relationship on the low, SK took the opportunity to hit up old girlfriends and interests during this downtime, according to the videos. Once the show aired, the exes put together the pieces of the shady timeline and put the Love Is Blind star on blast.</p><h2 id=who-is-sk-rsquo-s-ex-girlfriend-hannah-barrow>Who Is SK’s Ex-Girlfriend Hannah Barrow?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hannah Barrow aka @hannahbethstyle is an e-commerce manager and social media influencer living in Dallas, Texas (where the third season of Love Is Blind and the contestants are based).</p><p>According to the receipts on Barrow’s since-deleted TikTok, she revealed SK and the influencer dated in 2019 but broke up and remained good friends.</p><p><a href=#>As stated in the clip</a>, SK apparently reached out to Barrow to accompany him on a trip to Ibiza.

When the show aired and the poster realized her match was on Love Is Blind, she stated, she DM’d Raven to let her know of SK’s allegedly shady messaging, which she says she did not get a response on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-sk-and-raven-break-up>Did SK And Raven Break Up?</h2><p>In the Love Is Blind confessional, Raven confessed she usually went for types she would typically see or meet at the gym but with this experiment, she wanted to find a different kind of connection.</p><p>In the pods, <a href=#>she was torn between Bartise</a>, an accountant who is younger but physically more of her type, and SK, a Nigerian engineer whose emotional intelligence impressed the Pilates instructor and part-time bottle waitress.</p><p>In the end, she chose SK, whose cool, calm, and collected demeanor seemed to fulfill Raven’s emotional needs.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Much Did The Season 3 Cast Of Love Is Blind Get Paid?">How Much Did The Season 3 Cast Of Love Is Blind Get Paid?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans rooted for the pair to make it down the aisle, one of the catalysts for the breakup was that SK would be heading to northern California for two years shortly after filming to attend grad school at the University of California, Berkeley, while Raven was not comfortable uprooting her life and relocating.</p><p>Despite the distance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raven shared at the reunion</a> that the pair were making it work by understanding each other’s independence and goal-driven tendencies.</p><p>She said, "We're both very, very busy, but we're also very supportive of each other.”</p><p>The distance helped their relationship grow, the pair claimed, and they also took "a bunch of vacations" together to catch up on some quality time.</p><h2 id=where-are-sk-and-raven-now>Where Are SK And Raven Now?</h2><p>SK and Raven announced their breakup with <a href=#>a joint statement</a>, noting "We are saddened to announce that we have decided to go our separate ways.
