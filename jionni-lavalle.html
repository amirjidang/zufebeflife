Born on <strong>March 20, 1987, </strong>in New Jersey, LaValle has become a successful businessman in his own right, with ventures in clothing and real estate. Here is a timeline of Jionni LaValle’s life and career:</p><ul><li><strong>1987:</strong> Jionni LaValle is born in New Jersey.</li><li><strong>2009:</strong> LaValle meets his future wife, Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi, while they both attend a bar in Seaside Heights, New Jersey.</li><li><strong>2010:</strong> LaValle begins appearing on the MTV reality show “Jersey Shore” as Polizzi’s love interest.</li><li><strong>2011:</strong> LaValle and Polizzi briefly break up but reconcile later in the year.</li><li><strong>2012:</strong> LaValle and Polizzi announce they are expecting their first child together.</li><li><strong>2012: </strong>LaValle launches his clothing line, “Joey”, which features a range of graphic tees and accessories.</li><li><strong>2013: </strong>LaValle and Polizzi welcome their son, Lorenzo Dominic LaValle.</li><li><strong>2014:</strong> LaValle and Polizzi get married in a ceremony in New Jersey.</li><li><strong>2016:</strong> LaValle and Polizzi welcome their second child, a daughter named Giovanna Marie LaValle.</li><li><strong>2017:</strong> LaValle launches a real estate business focusing on buying and renovating distressed properties in New Jersey.</li><li><strong>2019:</strong> LaValle and Polizzi announce stepping away from “Jersey Shore” to focus on their family and businesses.</li></ul><p>Jionni LaValle’s time on “Jersey Shore” helped launch him into the public eye, but he has since established himself as a successful entrepreneur in his own right. His clothing line and real estate business have both been successful, and he and Polizzi have become known for their tight-knit family and strong work ethic. While he may no longer be a fixture on reality TV, LaValle continues to build his businesses and grow his brand.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=jionni-lavalle-s-age-and-physical-appearance><span id=Age_and_Physical_Appearance><strong>Age and Physical Appearance</strong></span></h3><p>Jionni LaValle is 36 years old.

He is also well-known on social media, with over 1.2 million Instagram followers and a large following on Twitter (@jlavalle5).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jionni-LaValle-Family-1024x1024.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=jionni-lavalle-s-relationship-and-marriage-life><span id=Relationship_and_Marriage_Life><strong>Relationship and Marriage Life</strong></span></h3><p>Jionni is blissfully<strong> </strong>married <strong>‘</strong>Snooki<strong>‘ </strong>Polizzi, also known as ‘Snooki’ Polizzi, and is widely considered a perfect gentleman.
