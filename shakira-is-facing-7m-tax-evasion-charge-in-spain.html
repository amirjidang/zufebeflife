She allegedly failed to pay the Spanish government €14.5 million ($14 million USD) in taxes between 2012 to 2014. At the time, she allegedly listed the Bahamas as her official residence for tax purposes. But Spanish prosecutors claims she spent the majority of time in Spain with her then-partner Gerard Pique and their two sons. According to Spanish laws, anyone residing in the country for six months or more per year is considered a resident and must pay taxes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In late September 2023, several outlets reported that Shakira had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">again been charged with tax evasion</a> in Spain. According to the BBC, Spanish tax authorities began investigating Shakira in July of that year, but held off on disclosing the open investigation; the outlet added:</p><p>"Prosecutors in Spain allege the singer defrauded the state of €6.7m ($7.1m, £5.8m) in 2018. They say this happened when she failed to declare millions in advance payments for her El Dorado World Tour, among other payments."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Shakira Wants To Buy Mansion That Can Only Be Reached By Helicopter</a></span></p><p>In April, Shakira disclosed plans to move to Miami from Barcelona, following her split from former partner Gerard Pique. At the time, Shakira said of her decision to relocate to Florida:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I settled in Barcelona to give my children a stability, the same we are now looking for in another corner of the world next to family, friends and the sea ... Today we start a new chapter in the pursuit of their happiness. Thank you to everyone who surfed alongside my many waves there in Barcelona, the city where I learned that friendship is certainly longer than love.”</p><p>On September 26th, news agency Reuters reported on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakira's purportedly unpaid $7 million tax bill</a>, explaining that the singer was accused of concealing revenues to avoid paying tax in Spain by stashing cash in offshore companies:</p><p>"In the [September 2023] case, the prosecutor alleges that in 2018, Shakira failed to declare profits of $12.5 million from an advance payment for her El Dorado World Tour, among others. At that time, she was in a relationship with FC Barcelona soccer star Gerard Pique and living in the city with their two children. Prosecutors argue that she was resident in Spain and so required to tax all her worldwide revenues there, no matter where they were earned. Instead, they say, she diverted money to 'companies domiciled in countries with low taxation and high opacity.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Teen Mom’ Star Maci Bookout Owes $26,000 In Taxes To California, Despite Never Living There</a></span></p><p>Representatives for Shakira had yet to acknowledge the tax charges filed in Spain in September at press time. According to Fox News, Shakira's rep <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed their client was unfairly targeted</a> by Spanish prosecutors in a prior statement to that outlet:</p><p>"Shakira has always cooperated and abided by the law, demonstrating impeccable conduct as an individual and a taxpayer, and faithfully following the counsel of PriceWaterhouse Coopers, a prestigious and globally recognized tax firm. Unfortunately, the Spanish Tax Office, which loses one out of every two lawsuits with its taxpayers, continues to violate her rights and pursue yet another baseless case. Shakira is confident that her innocence will be proven by the end of the judicial process."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shakira isn't the only celebrity to push back against tax authorities in 2023. In May, we reported on a lawsuit filed on behalf of <a href=#>Beyonce</a>, against the <a href=#>United States' Internal Revenue Service (IRS)</a> – in the suit, Beyonce disputed a $3 million IRS tax bill, asserting that "at least $868,766 of the money in dispute was donated to charity in 2018, and therefore qualifies as a tax deduction."</p><p>Shakira was expected to appear in court in Spain in November, for a trial in relation to the previous tax related charges. Prosecutors in Spain have requested a $25 million fine, and eight years of jail time should she be found guilty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKCRoLazrYyiqmaekZi2r7OMcKRmrJGteqbCwKygqKZdmLWivsaeZKKmXai9orXNaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fshakira-is-facing-7m-tax-evasion-charge-in-spain.html&text=Shakira%20Is%20Facing%20%247M%20Tax%20Evasion%20Charges%20In%20Spain%20%28Again%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshakira-is-facing-7m-tax-evasion-charge-in-spain.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshakira-is-facing-7m-tax-evasion-charge-in-spain.html&title=Shakira%20Is%20Facing%20%247M%20Tax%20Evasion%20Charges%20In%20Spain%20%28Again%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fshakira-is-facing-7m-tax-evasion-charge-in-spain.html&title=Shakira%20Is%20Facing%20%247M%20Tax%20Evasion%20Charges%20In%20Spain%20%28Again%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fshakira-is-facing-7m-tax-evasion-charge-in-spain.html&title=Shakira%20Is%20Facing%20%247M%20Tax%20Evasion%20Charges%20In%20Spain%20%28Again%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshakira-is-facing-7m-tax-evasion-charge-in-spain.html&description=Shakira%20Is%20Facing%20%247M%20Tax%20Evasion%20Charges%20In%20Spain%20%28Again%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./siobhan-cullen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Siobhan Cullen">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sean-preston-federline.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sean Preston Federline News - Us Weekly">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
