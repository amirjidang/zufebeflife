He later admitted that he was not very interested in acting when joining the film, but was inspired to study acting after developing feelings for his co-star, Alana Brady. He continued to act while still a member of PACE Youth Theatre. McAvoy graduated from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in 2000.</p><p>Throughout the early 2000s, he made guest appearances in television shows and began working in film. In 2001, McAvoy’s performance as a gay hustler in the play Out in the Open impressed director Joe Wright so much that Wright began offering McAvoy parts in his films. McAvoy kept declining them, however, and it was not until six years later that the two worked together.</p><p>He starred in Privates on Parade in the Donmar Warehouse, this time catching Sam Mendes’ attention. In 2001, the actor appeared as Private James W. Miller in Band of Brothers, an eleven-hour World War II miniseries by executive producers Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. He gained the attention of critics in 2002’s White Teeth, a four-part television drama miniseries adaption based on the novel of the same name by Zadie Smith.<br>On 4 March 2020, it was announced that Audible would be adapting Neil Gaiman’s acclaimed comic book series The Sandman into a multi-part audio drama, with McAvoy voicing the character of Dream.</p><p>McAvoy starred in Shakespeare’s Macbeth on London’s West End in early 2013. Macbeth was the first performance at the Trafalgar Transformed, running from 9 February until 27 April. The production was directed by Jamie Lloyd who also directed McAvoy in his last stint on the stage in 2009’s Three Days of Rain. In 2015, McAvoy won the Best Actor award at London’s Evening Standard Theater Awards for his portrayal of Jack Gurney in The Ruling Class, a revival of the Peter Barnes play directed by Jamie Lloyd. It ran at Trafalgar Studios from 16 January to 11 April 2015.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-james-mcavoy></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About James McAvoy</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is James McAvoy?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>James McAvoy is a Scottish actor.
