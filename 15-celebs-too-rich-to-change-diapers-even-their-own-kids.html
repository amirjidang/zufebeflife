But there are times when fortune can backfire and make you forget yourself, like when you become a parent, for example. If money was no object, I’m sure some of us might be tempted to get a bit of help now and then (leaving the kids with a sitter every other day so mom and dad can have quality time perhaps).</p><p>When it comes to everyday parenting duties, though (feeding, bathing, changing diapers, etc.), this is something you kind of have to do yourself at some point (no matter how much is in your bank account). Try telling that to some of these mega rich parents, though. The following celebs might be willing to bring a handful of kids into the world, but they don’t seem prepared to tackle the nitty-gritty parts of parenthood, specifically when it comes to diaper duty!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depressingly, the majority of these celeb ‘diaper deniers’ are men, which only goes to show just how far we still need to go before the whole housewife and stay-at-home mom stuff becomes a thing of the past. These celeb moms and dads presumably change their designer outfits more times than they change their kids’ own diapers.</p><h2 id=simon-cowell><strong>Simon Cowell</strong></h2><p>The British music mogul is worth around $550 million, owns three record labels, and has found talent from all corners of the globe throughout a nearly-16-year career as a reality TV judge. Despite all this, though, the supposed god of the entertainment industry can’t bring himself to change a dirty diaper.</p><p><strong>Cowell has previously said that he “won’t and can’t” change a nappy.</strong></p><p>Since having his first child with his glam socialite girlfriend Lauren Silverman in 2014, <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> has since admitted to changing a few diapers, but his attitude on who should be the one to do it seems pretty clear. After his son’s birth, he told Sky News, “I feed him and play with him, but I don’t think dads do nappies. I’ll leave that up to the nanny.” Nice!</p><h2 id=kanye-west><strong>Kanye West</strong></h2><p>Since having 3 kids, <a href=#>Kanye West</a> has learned to get on board with occasionally changing his own babies, but it took a lot of convincing. When Kimye first brought their little bundle of joy, North, into the world, the internet lost their sh*t and new daddy Kanye lost his nerve.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Yeezus reportedly came out and said that he refused to change his new daughter’s soiled diaper unless it was an “absolute emergency.”</strong></p><p>Okay… Since Saint and Chicago West came on the scene, perhaps Kanye has learned to be a little more responsible when it comes to parenting duties. But we doubt it. Apparently, <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> would love to have two or three more children in the future. Good luck with that. If you hire five or six nannies, then sure, because daddy West won’t be any help at all.</p><h2 id=matthew-mcconaughey><strong>Matthew McConaughey</strong></h2><p>The Wolf Of Wall Street&nbsp;actor might seem chill AF in most of his movie roles, but off-screen, there’s something that the Mac can’t seem to stomach in real life—the simple act of changing his kids when they had to go potty. In 2013, <a href=#>McConaughey</a> was spotted by paparazzi running home urgently and was later asked if it was to tend to the stinky needs of his then-newborn son. It’s fair to say that his response probably lost him a bit of respect from female fans. After his wife, Camila Alves, gave birth to their third child together in 2013, the True Detective star told reporters,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“I don’t change diapers. Somebody else does that.”</strong></p><p>McConaughey didn’t say whether the triple diaper duty was left up to his wife or a nanny, but he made it clear that he’s not about that life.</p><h2 id=julia-roberts><strong>Julia Roberts</strong></h2><p>The Pretty Woman actress may not have been in many film roles lately, but around the time of making her 2010 film Eat, Pray, Love, she had an entourage of people looking after her three kids—twin toddlers Hazel and Phinnaeus and youngest son Henry. Normally, celebs and nannies are nothing new, particularly when the celeb is away or working on set, but <a href=#>Julia Roberts</a> may rely on her kids’ ‘super nanny’ a little too much. Speaking to Access Hollywood in 2010,</p><p><strong>Roberts revealed that she would never be able to raise her children and work without the help of her hubby, friends, family, and a couple of “amazing women” who take care of her kids.</strong></p><p>We’re not expecting her to change diapers on a film set, but does she really need this kind of entourage to raise her own kids?</p><h2 id=pharell-williams><strong>Pharell Williams</strong></h2><p>The multi-millionaire musician caused ripples among parents last year when he revealed on an episode of The Today Show that he leaves the diaper-changing duties to his wife and their “entourage” of people. <a href=#>Pharrell Williams</a> has always seemed like a cool guy, so it’s kind of disappointing to learn that he swerves around one of the prime rites of passage in parenthood. Part of the reason Pharrell’s announcement caused such a backlash was because of the fact that his wife, Helen, had given birth to triplets at the time—triplets! Changing just one diaper several times a day is a messy job but three babies’ diapers? He could have at least taken a few for the team. Speaking of team,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Williams admitted to having what he describes as a “tribe and assembly line” to help out with his kids.</strong></p><p>Nice to compare raising your own brood to working in a factory.</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie><strong>Angelina Jolie</strong></h2><p>Of all the celeb moms on this list, <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> is one that is rarely pictured with a nanny in tow when out and about with her kids, which kind of leads us to believe that she’s some kind of superhuman. The truth is, Jolie does and has had more than her fair share of hired help in raising her six kids, which makes sense because it’s just not possible to look as good as she does everywhere.</p><p>Jolie and <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>’s eldest adopted children, Maddox and Pax, are now in their teens, and while they seem to have a close relationship with their celeb parents, the same can’t be said for Jolie’s youngest. A report in In Touch magazine revealed that some of Jolie’s kids refer to their many live-in nannies as ‘mommy’, suggesting that Angie isn’t around long enough to tuck them in bed, let alone change them.</p><h2 id=eddie-murphy><strong>Eddie Murphy</strong></h2><p>With a total of 9 children–ranging from his 1-year-old girl Izzy Oona to his 28-year-old daughter Bria–<a href=#>Eddie Murphy</a> has certainly had his hands full with fatherhood duties in the past few decades. But, whether he’s been a hands-on kind of dad is a different matter. The well-loved comedian definitely seems to be a dedicated dad to his young and grownup kids from a previous marriage, but he openly admits to avoiding the dirtiest parenting job of them all. In a recent interview with Extra,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Murphy admitted, “I don’t change diapers. I would be horrible at it and that’s not fair to the kid.”</strong></p><p>Since his eldest child is almost 30 now, we’ll never know if Murphy got his hands dirty once upon a time, but he doesn’t appear to want to start learning now!</p><h2 id=will-ferrell><strong>Will Ferrell</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Will Ferrell</a> has quite a handful at home with three sons with his wife, Viveca Paulin. And while the funnyman loves being a dad,</p><p><strong>he admits that changing diapers is one thing he absolutely refuses to do. “I let my wife do it. I’m not so good with it.”</strong></p><p>We can imagine that Ferrell is a warm and loving dad when it comes to making his kids laugh, but it’s a shame that like a lot of guys on this list, he leaves the dirty jobs to his significant other. The comic actor admits that his main job as a parent kicks in when it’s his kids’ bedtime. Speaking to People magazine in 2010 when his youngest son was only 7 months, Ferrell revealed that in place of changing dirty diapers, he “reads to them in bed and does the funny voices.” Cute, but seriously, Will? It wouldn’t kill you to help out with the not-so-fun side of being a parent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bubba-watson><strong>Bubba Watson</strong></h2><p>The Pro American golfer once suggested obnoxiously that being a champion justifies his reasons for refusing to change diapers. The arrival of <a href=#>Gerry Lester “Bubba” Watson</a>’s first child coincided with the Masters tournament in 2012. And when asked by a reporter if he had given his wife a hand in the diaper duties,</p><p><strong>he boasted with a smile that he “hadn’t changed one yet,” and then continuing to say, “I’m winning right now.”</strong></p><p>It’s a good thing that the pro golfer was at something because he wasn’t exactly winning at parenting (or marriage for that matter). Watson and his wife Angie’s son, Caleb, was already over a month old when he admitted to playing no part in it. Now, with a daughter in tow, Watson has since stepped up his diaper-changing game, but it’s quotes like this that make some celeb dads look way too out of touch.</p><h2 id=mike-tyson><strong>Mike Tyson</strong></h2><p>To look at <a href=#>Mike Tyson</a>, it wouldn’t seem as if he scares easy. The former pro boxer was once the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world at one point and has earned the nickname ‘Baddest man on the planet’ throughout his career. But apparently, kids going potty in their pants (especially his own children) is something that the bad-a*s man himself can’t and won’t bring himself to do. Tyson has a whopping total of 8 children from his previous marriages and</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>has flat-out refused to take part in the not-so-glitzy parts of being a parent</strong></p><p>(now that’s a hell of a lot of unchanged diapers left on your conscience!). The ex-boxer’s third wife has gushed before about what a great “hands-on” kind of dad he is. Hmm. At the end of the day, the guy who once bit another man’s ear off in a fight can’t handle his kids’ poop. That’s messed up.</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></h2><p>It shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that women in the Kardashian kingdom prefer to swerve the realistic responsibilities of being an adult, even when it comes to their own kids. Whether it’s flying the nest and getting a real job or caring for their babies, the Kardashian and Jenner clan mostly prefer to get outside help for it all, and young new mom Kylie Jenner is no exception.</p><p><strong>Since giving birth to her daughter, Stormi, earlier this year with her boyfriend, Travis Scott, the 20-year-old model and socialite has been struggling with the realities of motherhood.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jenner was reportedly so “overwhelmed” in the beginning and hated changing Stormi so much that she has vowed never to have another child again and now leaves a lot of the care to her nanny.</p><h2 id=gavin-rossdale><strong>Gavin Rossdale</strong></h2><p>Gwen Stefani’s ex might share three kids with the pop legend but he certainly didn’t share an even amount of the responsibilities with her. When it came to raising their sons, Kingston James, Zuma Nesta, and Apollo Bowie Flynn, Gavin found himself being too distracted by his phone to change the odd diaper every now and again. He admitted,</p><p><strong>“If there’s no one there I can do it, but otherwise, I sort of slide away – I get very interested in my Blackberry at that point.” Charming.</strong></p><p>As Rossdale sees it, though, kids never grow up thanking you for all the dirty jobs you do as parents, so why bother? “A friend told me once that ‘they never thank you, so don’t sweat it’. I thought it was good advice.” Maybe the kids won’t remember your diaper dodging, but your wife sure will.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></h2><p>Back in 2008, <a href=#>J-Lo</a> and her then-hubby,&nbsp;<a href=#>Marc Anthony</a>, set off an unusual trend in Hollywood for family members to become permanent live-in nannies and babysitters to their kids. But for J-Lo, this happened by accident when the couple had two nannies quit on them within three months of their twins being born. Oops! Things got so bad that they were unable to find a nanny, despite offering a 9,000 monthly salary!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources reportedly revealed at the time that nobody was biting because J-Lo didn’t just want help with her twins, but she also wanted someone to work 16 hours a day 7 days a week with the twins. Eventually, Lopez employed her mom to share baby care duties (and presumably diaper duties), and it wasn’t long before Grandma Guadalupe moved in with them!</p><h2 id=bow-wow><strong>Bow Wow</strong></h2><p>Rapper <a href=#>Bow Wow</a> became a pretty young first-time dad in 2011 with his daughter, Shai, so this might explain why he’s stumped by some of the less-than-glamorous sides to taking care of babies. Bow Wow (real name Shad Gregory Moss) had only just turned 24 when he and his now ex-girlfriend, Joie Chavis, welcomed their new baby girl, and it’s fair to say that the rapper still feels like a kid himself. While on the Anderson Cooper ‘Live’ Show in 2012, Bow Wow opened up about the fact that being a young dad is a fun but messy business, but one important part of the mess isn’t something he’s the best at.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>He told host Anderson Cooper that he mostly leaves that up to Shai’s mom.</strong></p><p>Cooper gave the young rapper a special diaper changing vest and butch daddy bag to encourage him to be more hands-on in the future. Hopefully, that’ll work.</p><h2 id=donald-trump><strong>Donald Trump</strong></h2><p>You probably already knew this about the current President, but it doesn’t make it any less disgusting. <a href=#>Trump</a> has always had a lot to say on the subject of child rearing (or the lack of it) in the past, but one that has caused the most fuss before is the fact that he admitted to being</p><p><strong>a “hands-off” dad when it came to diaper changing all five of his kids.</strong></p><p>Since having Barron Trump with his wife, Melania, Trump has stuck by his ‘no diaper’ duty stance, almost to the point that he wears it like a badge of honor, claiming, “Men who change diapers are acting like the wife. Melania is a wonderful mother, she takes care of the baby and I pay all of the costs.” Hopefully, Daddy Donny has some spare for when Barron needs adult therapy someday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWKwprjEm6pmrJ%2BkerO1wqFkraddmLWiusaeZJ2hkaWys7%2BMnq2epl2ptaa10WamsKZdoLalv44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-celebs-too-rich-to-change-diapers-even-their-own-kids.html&text=15%20Celebs%20Too%20Rich%20To%20Change%20Diapers%20%28Even%20Their%20Own%20Kids%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-celebs-too-rich-to-change-diapers-even-their-own-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-celebs-too-rich-to-change-diapers-even-their-own-kids.html&title=15%20Celebs%20Too%20Rich%20To%20Change%20Diapers%20%28Even%20Their%20Own%20Kids%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-celebs-too-rich-to-change-diapers-even-their-own-kids.html&title=15%20Celebs%20Too%20Rich%20To%20Change%20Diapers%20%28Even%20Their%20Own%20Kids%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-celebs-too-rich-to-change-diapers-even-their-own-kids.html&title=15%20Celebs%20Too%20Rich%20To%20Change%20Diapers%20%28Even%20Their%20Own%20Kids%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-celebs-too-rich-to-change-diapers-even-their-own-kids.html&description=15%20Celebs%20Too%20Rich%20To%20Change%20Diapers%20%28Even%20Their%20Own%20Kids%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-times-the-walking-dead-was-less-violent-than-the-comics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Times The Walking Dead Was Less Violent Than The Comics">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-10-most-terrifying-robots-ever-built.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 of the Most Terrifying Robots Ever Built">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
