However, Stern's career has also gotten him in trouble because he is so candid about his opinions. In fact, Stern is so forthright that <a href=#>his comments have led to violence</a> in the past.</p><p>Since Stern is such an open host, he often gets guests to say things they ordinarily would never admit publicly. One perfect example of that is the fact that Stern got Rodney Dangerfield to be very forthright about his family.</p><h2 id=the-tragic-and-true-story-of-rodney-dangerfield-39-s-family>The Tragic And True Story Of Rodney Dangerfield's Family</h2><p>During Rodney Dangerfield's lengthy standup comedy career, he made millions of people laugh. As anyone familiar with Dangerfield will already know, Dangerfield often made people laugh by making fun of himself and his family. However, Dangerfield once spoke about his family during an appearance on The Howard Stern Show and what he said was no laughing matter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rodney-dangerfield-looking-sad.jpg><p>Around a year before Rodney Dangerfield passed away, he made an appearance on The Howard Stern Show. While the comedian tried to throw in jokes throughout the resulting interview, it is astonishing how serious the conversation was from the start.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When and where was Rodney Dangerfield born</a>, according to Brittanica?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>When was Rodney Dangerfield born:</p></td><td><p>November 22, 1921</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Where was Rodney Dangerfield born:</p></td><td><p>Babylon, Long Island, New York</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>When did Rodney Dangerfield die:</p></td><td><p>October 5, 2004</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How old was Rodney Dangerfield when he died:</p></td><td><p>82 years old</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time of his appearance, Dangerfield had relatively recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gotten out of the hospital following brain surgery</a>. After Stern brought that up, they began talking about Dangerfield's memoir, which had been released around that time. The second Dangerfield mentioned his book, Stern summed up how the reality of the comedian's life made him feel.</p><p>"I read the book. Sad life."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jimmy-fallon-and-howard-stern-revealed-the-most-humiliating-part.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jimmy Fallon And Howard Stern Revealed The Most Humiliating Part Of Being A New Talk Show Host</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jimmy Fallon told Howard Stern about one of the most embarrassing part of being a talk show host nobody thinks about.</span><p>After making that comment, Stern bluntly asked Dangerfield if he agreed he'd had a sad life. Instead of answering that question directly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dangerfield reflected on his difficult childhood</a>, much to Robin Quivers' astonishment.</p><p>"I think back in my life, when I had to, we went around my old neighborhood where I was brought up as a kid. You know? It's, uh, I didn't have it easy. No. It was like a, roaming the streets at four years old alone on Jamaica Avenue, was over there. 'Oh, what a busy street. Wow.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From there, Dangerfield revealed a terrible thing that happened to him because he was left alone at such a young age. As Dangerfield explained to Stern and his audience, an adult male who lived in his area took advantage of the comedian when he was a child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rodney-dangerfield-wearing-a-suit.jpg><p>As their conversation progressed, Stern brought up the subject of Dangerfield's parents. Stern did this by initially calling out Dangerfield's mother in no uncertain terms. "First of all, your mother, horrible woman."</p><p>If you told most people they had a horrible mother, they would become defensive. In Dangerfield's case, however, he didn't seem to take any offense, even if he didn't describe his mom quite as harshly as Stern did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She was very, very selfish... I mean, she wasn't nice to me, at all, you know? Not a hug or kiss my entire youth. Not one. I didn't say it for some reason. If I'm eight years old, 'Hey Mom, why don't you ever hug me? I just never got around. She didn't beat me, no.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/why-howard-stern-said-hearing-jay-leno-s-name-made-him-want-to-vomit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Howard Stern Said Hearing Jay Leno's Name Made Him Want To Vomit</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Howard Stern's rant about Jay Leno made it clear the shock jock couldn't stand the former host of The Tonight Show.</span><p>In response to Dangerfield's comments about his mother, Stern asked the comedian if the lack of love left him angry. "Was there a bitterness inside? Why did everybody else get the love of a mother and I didn't?"</p><p>According to Dangerfield, he didn't let the circumstances of his childhood define him or make him angry. Instead, he opted to be generous to the people he cared about and thankful that he turned out okay, and he enjoyed a great deal of success.</p><p>After Dangerfield explained his mentality, Quivers asked about his father. Before Dangerfield could respond, Stern gave his take on the man. "Dad was a horror scene, wasn't he?" When Dangerfield tried to say his father was okay, Stern took exception to that and asked when Dangerfield's dad left him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/howard-stern-s-now-deceased-guest-was-banned-from-the-show-after-disrespecting-his-staff-behind-the-scenes-front-deposit-back-howard-stern-show-_youtube.jpg><p>According to what Dangerfield told Stern, his father "was never there". When Stern asked Dangerfield how his father was okay if he abandoned his child, Dangerfield tried to explain his perspective. According to Dangerfield, he blamed his mother for his father's absence.</p><p>"Because he married my mother, he knocked her up to be honorable. You understand me? And he ended up screwed because she was not nice at all... Not only that, but he was a nicer person generally... I get along with him okay. You know? Even though he saw me... He saw me two hours a year. He saw me twice a year, for an hour each time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In response to the situation, Stern and Quivers asked why his father never took him away from his mother if she was so bad. After Dangerfield explained that he didn't fit into his father's lifestyle, he spoke about his mother again. This time around, Dangerfield explained that his mother resented him because of what her son represented to her.</p><p>'I represent all men to her. I once said to her, I once said to my mother. You know? 'Do you think you'd ever get married again ma?' She said, 'What me? Cook and clean for a man?' She hates everybody."</p><h2 id=rodney-dangerfield-had-a-difficult-relationship-with-his-kids>Rodney Dangerfield Had A Difficult Relationship With His Kids</h2><p>After Rodney Dangerfield spoke about his troubled childhood on The Howard Stern Show, Howard Stern asked the comedian an obvious question.

Obviously shocked by Dangerfield's answer, Quivers asked the comedian for clarification. "Because of the kids' attitude?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rodney-dangerfield-looking-shocked.jpg><p>After taking a few seconds to consider how to respond, Dangerfield restated that his children's attitudes were the problem. Ultimately, Dangerfield tried to explain what he meant when Quivers asked him, "So your kids are giving you a tough time?"</p><p>"Well, kids, they don't mean to. They're just what they are."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyond that, Dangerfield explained that he didn't want to tell any stories about his kids. However, when Stern asked Dangerfield if his kids wanted more money, he laughed and didn't respond, which gave the impression that was the problem.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipqJyemsZusMCnnp6qlp6yrbCMn5imoZyueqS0yKWbq52eYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnHqK6aqpRiwLWx0adkoqakmr%2B3tcSwZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frodney-dangerfield-family-children-relationship-howard-stern-interview.html&text=Rodney%20Dangerfield%20Revealed%20The%20Sad%20Truth%20About%20His%20Family%20During%20A%20Raw%20interview%20With%20Howard%20Stern%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frodney-dangerfield-family-children-relationship-howard-stern-interview.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frodney-dangerfield-family-children-relationship-howard-stern-interview.html&title=Rodney%20Dangerfield%20Revealed%20The%20Sad%20Truth%20About%20His%20Family%20During%20A%20Raw%20interview%20With%20Howard%20Stern%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frodney-dangerfield-family-children-relationship-howard-stern-interview.html&title=Rodney%20Dangerfield%20Revealed%20The%20Sad%20Truth%20About%20His%20Family%20During%20A%20Raw%20interview%20With%20Howard%20Stern%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frodney-dangerfield-family-children-relationship-howard-stern-interview.html&title=Rodney%20Dangerfield%20Revealed%20The%20Sad%20Truth%20About%20His%20Family%20During%20A%20Raw%20interview%20With%20Howard%20Stern%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frodney-dangerfield-family-children-relationship-howard-stern-interview.html&description=Rodney%20Dangerfield%20Revealed%20The%20Sad%20Truth%20About%20His%20Family%20During%20A%20Raw%20interview%20With%20Howard%20Stern%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sandro-maniaci-of-wicked-tuna.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sandro Maniaci Of Wicked Tuna">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./riverdales-ryan-grantham-allegedly-planned-to-kill-justin-trudeau.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Riverdale's Ryan Grantham Allegedly Planned to Kill Justin Trudeau">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
