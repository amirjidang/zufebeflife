Mick Fleetwood was among those to issue a statement.</p><p>He wrote, "This is a day where my dear sweet friend Christine McVie has taken to flight.. and left us earthbound folks to listen with bated breath to the sounds of that 'Song Bird'... reminding one and all that love is all around us to reach for and touch in this previous life that is gifted to us. Part of my heart has flown away today.. I will miss everything about you Christine McVie. Memories abound... they fly to me."</p><p>Stevie Nicks was extra emotional writing her tribute to McVie, given that she wasn't aware of the gravity of McVie's medical situation at the time. It was all unexpected for Nicks who wished she could've spent more time with her best friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"A few hours ago I was told that my best friend in the whole world since the first day of 1975, had passed away. I didn't even know she was ill... until late Saturday night. I wanted to be in London; I wanted to get to London â€” but we were told to wait. So, since Saturday, one song has been swirling around in my head, over and over and over. I thought I might possibly get to sing it to her, and so, I'm singing it to her now. I always knew I would need these words one day. It's all I can do now."</p><p>Bill Clinton also issued a touching tribute. Of course, the band played their iconic, 'Don't Stop' during his campaign run, which became the theme song.</p><p>SOURCES - People & Daily Mail</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmLWztdKtoKedXaKwt7XEZqOemaaaeqK62Gamn2WYmr9uss6rq66mlWLBsHnFpZyerKekvKV5zJqaaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-christine-mcvie-leave-any-of-her-fortune-to-fleetwood-mac.html&text=Did%20Christine%20McVie%20Leave%20Any%20Of%20Her%20Fortune%20To%20Fleetwood%20Mac%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-christine-mcvie-leave-any-of-her-fortune-to-fleetwood-mac.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-christine-mcvie-leave-any-of-her-fortune-to-fleetwood-mac.html&title=Did%20Christine%20McVie%20Leave%20Any%20Of%20Her%20Fortune%20To%20Fleetwood%20Mac%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-christine-mcvie-leave-any-of-her-fortune-to-fleetwood-mac.html&title=Did%20Christine%20McVie%20Leave%20Any%20Of%20Her%20Fortune%20To%20Fleetwood%20Mac%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-christine-mcvie-leave-any-of-her-fortune-to-fleetwood-mac.html&title=Did%20Christine%20McVie%20Leave%20Any%20Of%20Her%20Fortune%20To%20Fleetwood%20Mac%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-christine-mcvie-leave-any-of-her-fortune-to-fleetwood-mac.html&description=Did%20Christine%20McVie%20Leave%20Any%20Of%20Her%20Fortune%20To%20Fleetwood%20Mac%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./did-nicole-mitchell-murphys-career-benefit-after-eddie-murphy-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Nicole Mitchell Murphy's Career Benefit After Her Tumultuous Divorce From Eddie Murphy?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./aaron-carters-death-changed-nick-carter-relationship-with-siblings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Aaron Carter's Death Tear Nick Carter Further Away From His Siblings Or Bring Them Closer Togeth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
