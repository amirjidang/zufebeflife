These people come from all walks of life, and they all have to work insanely hard to get to where they want to be. Turns out, landing a role in a franchise like the <a href=#>MCU</a> or <a href=#>Star Wars</a> can changed everything in an instant for a performer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stephen Lang has been around Hollywood for years, but most people know him from his time in the <a href=#>Avatar</a> franchise. Lang has amassed an impressive net worth over time, and people were shocked to learn that he comes from a wealthy family. There is, however, more than meets the eye about his net worth.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at Stephen Lang's net worth.</p><h2 id=stephen-lang-has-been-a-success>Stephen Lang Has Been A Success</h2><p>While he might not be one of the biggest names in Hollywood, Stephen Lang is a performer that virtually everyone has seen in at least one movie or television show. The actor has been performing since the 1980s, and during his time in show business, Lang has been able to rack up some seriously impressive credits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the big screen, Lang has done quite well for himself, even though he never turned into a star on the same level as someone like Brad Pitt. Lang has been in movies like Gettysburg, Tombstone, Public Enemies, and Avatar. Trust us when we say that there are far more credits than that for them actor.</p><p>Much like his time on the big screen, Lang has done a lot of television work. He has been on shows like The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, The Outer Limits, Law & Order: SVU, Psych, and Into the Badlands.</p><p>Naturally, the actor's time in Hollywood has done wonders for his net worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Pete Davidson's Net Worth Compared To Other 'SNL' Stars When They Were His Age</a></span></p><h2 id=he-has-amassed-an-impressive-net-worth>He Has Amassed An Impressive Net Worth</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Stephen Lang is currently worth $5 million, which is quite impressive. Again, Lang has never been an A-list star, but despite this, he has been able to make a pretty penny thanks to his work.</p><p>At this time, there isn't a lot of definitive salary information available for Stephen Lang, but when looking at the projects that he has appeared in, it becomes quite clear where he made his money.</p><p>Avatar, for instance, is the highest-grossing movie of all time, and Lang had a large role in the film. He more than likely made a solid upfront pay, and once the movie went on to make billions of dollars at the box office, he probably got to collect some hefty residual checks. If you see that movie playing on television, just know that Lang is getting paid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, Stephen Lang has done well for himself, but people in the know are aware that the actor comes from a very wealthy family. It certainly has some wondering about the truth of his net worth and how it came to be.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Richest Living Members Of The Rothschild Family, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=he-comes-from-money-but-made-his-own>He Comes From Money, But Made His Own</h2><p>Eugene Lang, Stephen's father, was an incredibly wealthy and successful man who did a whole lot of good in this world. Lang was a self-made millionaire, and he was the founder of the "I Have A Dream Foundation."</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>, Lang had given away $150 million during his lifetime, and he lent a helping hand to over 16,000 students. Despite all that he gave away to others, Eugene was not intent on leaving millions behind for his children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eugene himself said, "Look, I gave them good educations and every encouragement to make it on their own. They should be able to stand tall.”</p><p>In 2006, he would say, "A good education is to learn to be self-supporting so that they can build their own inheritance. I never believed in luxuries. I still pick up a penny on the street.”</p><p>Now, some people might hear something like this and assume that Stephen would be bothered by not getting a cent from his father, but this could not be further from the truth. In fact, Stephen could not have cared less, and he was more than happy with getting the most important thing from his father.</p><p>"My father has a very healthy respect for what money can do but ultimately thinks it’s quite a corrupting thing. The major thing Dad’s given me has been his support and inspiration. In that sense I’m as rich as anyone," Stephen said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Vs.
