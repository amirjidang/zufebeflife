Show stars <a href=#>Shep Rose</a> and Taylor Ann Green have ended their relationship after two years of dating. During trailers of the current season of the show, fans could see the two of them struggling to get along. However, it was after filming wrapped for the season in which the two of them broke up. Rose had originally spoken highly of their relationship just last month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that there were several problems in their relationship, but that the issue that led to their breakup was Rose's issues with commitment. "Shep has a real issue with monogamy and refused to commit to Taylor, telling her that he doesn't want to be with just one person and change his lifestyle," said a source. "She's incredibly hurt, but she knows that she deserves a guy who will fight for her, not one who is so selfish. He'll regret this."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rose has been on Southern Charm since season one, being one of two cast members who have been on the show since the beginning. Green was added as a cast member for the current season. This setup is similar to that of <a href=#>Kathryn Dennis and Chleb Ravenell</a>, who recently broke up after more than a year of dating.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here’s How ‘Southern Charm’ Fans Really Feel About Shep Rose</a></span></p><h2 id=the-reason-for-their-breakup-was-not-shocking>The Reason For Their Breakup Was Not Shocking</h2><p>During last season's reunion show, Rose spoke to Andy Cohen and admitted to cheating on Green. He had sparked up conversations with an ex-girlfriend over phone, and had kissed a girl in a stairwell. As of this publication, it is unclear what those text messages said, and if his latest infidelities involve those women he mentioned during the television special.</p><p>Leaving bachelorhood seemed to be on the horizon for Rose, who credited Green for helping him turn over a new leaf, and admitted that he is "a boisterous, passionate, idiotic human being." He then said that he was coming to terms that he is older than he used to be and is becoming an old man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast of Bravo's 'Southern Charm' Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></span></p><h2 id=one-of-their-most-notable-arguments-recently-aired-on-bravo>One Of Their Most Notable Arguments Recently Aired On Bravo</h2><p>Earlier this season, the two got into an intense argument regarding their future and their reactions to Green's pregnancy scare. While Rose had a happy response, his now-ex asked, "You're gonna high five to my pain and misery?" She claimed that he did not ask her how she felt about the situation, and that he hadn't done anything to prove that he could be trusted during life-changing issues. Green then finished it off by telling him that she doesn't consider him to be "a safe bet," pointing to the fact that he'd told her that he "doesn't want to get married and settle down."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rose clapped back at her statements, and offered her no comfort. "The minute you tell me I need to do something a certain way, I will do the exact opposite... but I want you," he said, adding that if Green did want a more formal commitment, the two could "cross that bridge when we come to it." Unfortunately, their chances of crossing that bridge are incredibly slim if not none.</p><p>Social media has sided with Green throughout the breakup, with several users saying she is too good for Rose. On an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> from the Fourth of July, a user commented, "He’s not your soul mate. Run. He's not marriage material."
