A perfect example of that is Murphy couldn't control the headlines about what happened after he got divorced or what happened to his ex-wife's career.</p><h2 id=how-getting-divorced-helped-eddie-murphy-39-s-ex-wife-39-s-career>How Getting Divorced Helped Eddie Murphy's Ex-Wife's Career</h2><p>During Eddie Murphy's career, the famous actor has made some mistakes including <a href=#>passing on a franchise that became incredibly successful</a>. Thankfully for Murphy, however, he has starred in a long list of movies that went on to be considered all-time classics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/eddie-murphy-and-mike-myers-made-millions-together-thanks-to-the-shrek-franchise-but-do-they-actually-like-each-other_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to Murphy's roles in several legendary '80s comedies, he has remained successful ever since. Most notably, Murphy starred in the Shrek film franchise alongside the likes of Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, and many more popular actors.</p><p>Murphy's incredible filmography earned him the ability to demand some incredible paydays over the years. As of the time of this writing, Celebrity Net Worth reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Murphy has a $200 million fortune</a>.</p><p>After Murphy became famous, he met and fell for a woman named Nicole Mitchell. In 1993, the couple walked down the aisle, and they would stay married for more than a decade. In 2005, Murphy's wife who was then known as Nicole Mitchell Murphy filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Eddie Murphy Box Office Disaster Ruined Ron Underwood's Career As A Film Director</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time the former couple finalized their divorce, the year was 2006 and Mitchell Murphy walked away with a significant amount of money. According to reports, the divorce settlement called for Mitchell Murphy to get $15 million.</p><p>Almost certainly thanks to the fortune that Mitchell Murphy got from her divorce, she was able to advance her career in a big way. Years after Mitchell Murphy worked as a model, she founded and became the CEO of a company that is designed to help other people look their best.</p><p>On the website for Mitchell Murphy's company, Y-FOY, there is a section that tells the story of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what her products are supposed to do for customers</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nicole-mitchell-murphy-s-company-y-foy-products.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"YFOY was founded to share Nicole’s tried and true secrets to looking and feeling youthful, beautiful, and confident with women all over the world.

YFOY is about embracing who you are and owning it. There’s no need to search for the Fountain of youth, it’s already within each of us!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the company's website, several different products can be ordered as of the time of this writing.

One of several women tapped to star in the VH1 reality show Hollywood Exes, Mitchell Murphy appeared in every episode of the series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hollywood-exes-cast-photo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of Mitchell Murphy, Hollywood Exes also starred Sheree Fletcher, Andrea Kelly, Jessica Canseco, Mayte Garcia, Shamicka Lawrence, and Shanna Moakler among others. For those who are unfamiliar with those names, each woman was involved with a huge star.</p><p>Amazingly enough, it could easily be argued that at least one of Hollywood Exes stars was married to someone more famous than Eddie Murphy since Will Smith's ex was part of the show. Some of the other celebrities whose exes starred in the show include Martin Lawrence, baseball player Jose Canseco, R.

While there isn't any proof that Mitchell Murphy was targeted because of her divorce, it seems very safe to assume that the headlines about her settlement played a role in what happened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/what-happened-to-the-con-man-who-swindled-eddie-murphy-s-ex-wife-nicole-out-the-7-million-she-got-in-the-divorce_-2.jpg><p>In a report that was published by The Daily Mail, it was revealed that a man named Troy Stratos scammed Mitchell Murphy out of most of her assets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's alleged Stratos then persuaded Murphy to invest the proceeds of her 2006 divorce overseas, promising that she would earn a high rate of return. She put $ 11 million into a revocable trust with Stratos, giving him full access to her personal finances, including real estate and jewelry."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/eddie-murphy-and-nicole-mitchell-with-their-family-before-their-divorce.jpg><p>The Daily Mail then went on to reveal what Stratos really did with Mitchell Murphy's money. "But prosecutors say the conman - recently convicted for concocting an $11 million fraud involving Facebook stock - never invested the money, but used it to fund his own extravagant lifestyle."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The report continued, "The 50-year-old Stratos also allegedly opened a bank account in Florida and used portions of the money to pay Murphy's expenses while they were on a trip in Europe together, claiming he was paying for her out of his own pocket."</p><p>After Stratos was found guilty, he pleaded with the judge for mercy. That turned out to be a futile effort as Stratos was sentenced to 21 years and 10 months in prison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdo7aku8ueZKahpJi1prjLZqSuqqCdxrR5wpqpnp2iYq%2BmusSfoK1lkZvBpr6MnpudoZViura%2Bz6GwZpyZq7yzr8Ro</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-nicole-mitchell-murphys-career-benefit-after-eddie-murphy-divorce.html&text=Did%20Nicole%20Mitchell%20Murphy%27s%20Career%20Benefit%20After%20Her%20Tumultuous%20Divorce%20From%20Eddie%20Murphy%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-nicole-mitchell-murphys-career-benefit-after-eddie-murphy-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-nicole-mitchell-murphys-career-benefit-after-eddie-murphy-divorce.html&title=Did%20Nicole%20Mitchell%20Murphy%27s%20Career%20Benefit%20After%20Her%20Tumultuous%20Divorce%20From%20Eddie%20Murphy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-nicole-mitchell-murphys-career-benefit-after-eddie-murphy-divorce.html&title=Did%20Nicole%20Mitchell%20Murphy%27s%20Career%20Benefit%20After%20Her%20Tumultuous%20Divorce%20From%20Eddie%20Murphy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-nicole-mitchell-murphys-career-benefit-after-eddie-murphy-divorce.html&title=Did%20Nicole%20Mitchell%20Murphy%27s%20Career%20Benefit%20After%20Her%20Tumultuous%20Divorce%20From%20Eddie%20Murphy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-nicole-mitchell-murphys-career-benefit-after-eddie-murphy-divorce.html&description=Did%20Nicole%20Mitchell%20Murphy%27s%20Career%20Benefit%20After%20Her%20Tumultuous%20Divorce%20From%20Eddie%20Murphy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./eison-chai-wife-who-is-hitomi-wang.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eison Chai Wife: Who Is Hitomi Wang?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./did-christine-mcvie-leave-any-of-her-fortune-to-fleetwood-mac.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Christine McVie Leave Any Of Her Fortune To Fleetwood Mac?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
