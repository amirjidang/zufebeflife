True fans of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends</a> know this character feels so comfortable around women because he grew up with SEVEN sisters. (Points if you can remember all their names!)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gina, Tina, Dina, Mary-Angela, Mary-Therese, Veronica, and Cookie all appear in early seasons of Friends before two of them were recast and featured in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">short-lived spin-off, Joey</a>.</p><p>Matt LeBlanc's Joey couldn't have existed without these fiery female characters. They were the reason for jokes like "she went to college! All two years!" and adding yet another messed-up experience to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joey and Chandler's odd friendship</a>. Remember them confusing Chandler with their lookalike faces and similar senses of style? But hey, you can't go wrong with a bold red.</p><p>Think any of the Tribbiani sisters look familiar? You might have seen a few of them on other hit TV shows and movies over the years - but for some, it's a "moo point" to even bring up their acting careers since then.</p><h2 id=veronica-tina-and-dina-1-retired>Veronica, Tina, and Dina #1 Retired</h2><p>Three Tribbianni sisters walked away from show business in the '90s. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to IMDB</a>, 'Tina' was played by Lisa Maris, and she retired from acting after doing a few made-for-TV movies around the time that her Friends episode aired.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>'Dina' was originally played by someone named Lisa, too. Lisa Melilli played minor characters in Frasier, Married With Children, and Murder, She Wrote before retiring from the acting in 1997.</p><p>The actress who played 'Veronica' was maybe the most minor Tribbiani sister featured on&nbsp;Friends. She didn't get any lines, and her only other acting credit is appearing as Rosie O'Donnell's body double in The Flintstones. Veronica's real name? DENA. We're starting to feel like Chandler here.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is What Friends’ Gunther Looks Like Today</a></span></p><h2 id=dina-2-is-a-celebrity-blogger>Dina #2 Is A Celebrity Blogger</h2><p>The second time viewers saw 'Dina,' she was played by TV regular, Marla Sokoloff. She was already a familiar face to anyone who watched Full House (as Stephanie's rebellious friend Gia), and she's since reprised that role on Fuller House.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Friends, she had her moment in the spotlight when she got "knocked up" by someone who was "missing a shoe" and Joey tried to host an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">impromptu wedding ceremony</a> for her and the baby daddy. These days she's a mom IRL who works as an IG influencer and a celebrity blogger for People Magazine.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Friends': 15 Times Joey Tribbiani Was A Low Key Genius</a></span></p><h2 id=mary-angela-mary-therese-and-cookie-still-on-tv>Mary Angela, Mary Therese, and Cookie: Still On TV</h2><p>'Mary Angela' is the Tribbiani sister who Chandler hooked up with on a rebound from Janice, and she's played by actress Holly Gagnier. IMDB shows she's done loads of acting work since Friends, on everything from Days of Our Lives to Scandal.</p><p>Mimi Lieber played 'Mary Therese,' the sister who made out with Chandler in the hallway of Joey's grandmother's house. Before Friends, she was hitting it big on shows like Beverly Hills, 90210,&nbsp;and The X Files. Since then, she's had recurring roles on Law & Order and Judging Amy, and even had jobs on Broadway as a dancer and choreographer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesser-Known Facts Behind The Making Of NBC's Friends</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>'Cookie' might be the most memorable original Tribbiani sister. She's the one who punched Chandler after he kissed Mary Therese, and who told Phoebe she shot her husband. These days you can see her as Maureen Bennett in Why Women Kill, or as Katherine in Jane The Virgin and Isabella in Telenovella. Work it, Cookie.</p><h2 id=both-ginas-stay-busy>Both Ginas Stay Busy</h2><p>'Gina' wasn't a standout sister in Friends, but she was still one of the original seven. She was played by actress K.J. Steinberg, who has since stepped behind the cameras as a top TV producer. According to MTV, she's produced the (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">possibly soon-to-be-rebooted</a>) show Gossip Girl, The Nine, State of Mind, and currently, Mistresses. She's also written for This Is Us and Lawless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Joey, Gina was recast and played by Drea de Matteo. Often confused with Ellen DeGeneres' wife Portia de Rossi, Drea has an impressive career all her own. She's been a series regular on Desperate Housewives, Sons of Anarchy, Shades of Blue, and most recently, A Million Little Things. You can see her next as Maya in Paradise City, an NBC show about wild and rowdy punk musicians (one played by Bella Thorne!). No offense to Joey, but those are some pretty impressive acting chops for a Tribbiani.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston And Lisa Kudrow Admit Watching ‘Friends’ Bloopers For Hours</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0edahnKudXZa%2FpnnJqJyyZaSntqOuyJqloqtdqLa0wMSrqmasn5muuns%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffriends-where-are-joey-tribbianis-sisters-today.html&text=Where%20Are%20Joey%20Tribbiani%27s%20Sisters%20Today%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffriends-where-are-joey-tribbianis-sisters-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffriends-where-are-joey-tribbianis-sisters-today.html&title=Where%20Are%20Joey%20Tribbiani%27s%20Sisters%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffriends-where-are-joey-tribbianis-sisters-today.html&title=Where%20Are%20Joey%20Tribbiani%27s%20Sisters%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffriends-where-are-joey-tribbianis-sisters-today.html&title=Where%20Are%20Joey%20Tribbiani%27s%20Sisters%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffriends-where-are-joey-tribbianis-sisters-today.html&description=Where%20Are%20Joey%20Tribbiani%27s%20Sisters%20Today%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-american-sprinter-sydney-mclaughlins-husband-she-married-andre-levrone-jr-in-2022-358137-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is American Sprinter Sydney McLaughlins Husband?
