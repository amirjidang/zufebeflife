Many of them have their own beauty team that typically includes hair stylists, and makeup artists. According to the Daily Mail, <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> has even spent $21,600 on a power facial. Although this is shocking to the public, it's not uncommon for famous people to dish out that kind of cash to look perfect at all times. For celebs who are photographed often, the risk of having embarrassing pictures go viral on Twitter or Instagram is horrifying and hard to live down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, there have been a handful of celebrities who have shown off their unusual ways with pictures, some that include hairy armpits, some have even sported this look on the&nbsp;red carpet. The reasons include wanting to send a message about embracing one's body, some have forgotten&nbsp;that they missed a few hairs, and some&nbsp;simply don't&nbsp;care. With all the stress and money spent on getting ready for star-studded red carpet events, it can happen that some celebs forget to take care of the small areas of the body. When this tiny mistake occurs, it can haunt them forever in the form of images spread across the internet.</p><p>Let's take a look at 10 celebs and their&nbsp;hairy armpits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=madonna>10. Madonna</h2><p>In 2014, superstar singer <a href=#>Madonna</a> shocked her fans after posting a picture on Instagram that revealed her grown out underarm hair. Below the image she wrote, "Long hair...... Don't Care!!!!!! #artforfreedom #rebelheart #revolutionoflove.” The Queen of Pop has opted out of shaving her armpits in the past. Several years ago she told Harpar's Bazaar about her decision in high school not to shave body hair: "I refused to wear makeup, to have a hairstyle. I refused to shave. I had hairy armpits." Madonna went on to say, "The boys in my school would make fun of me... 'Hairy monster.' You know, things like that."</p><p></p><h2 id=julia-roberts>9. Julia Roberts</h2><p>During the premiere of Notting Hill, actress <a href=#>Julia Roberts</a> was photographed on the red carpet with armpit hair. She seemed unaware of this as she waved to fans repeatedly on the red carpet with a big smile on her face. Luckily, her boyfriend at the time,&nbsp;actor <a href=#>Benjamin Bratt,</a>&nbsp;said during an interview that he liked Julia's underarm hair and natural body scent. Years later, America's sweetheart was swimming in Hawaii with her husband and unabashedly allowed paparazzi to take photos of her hairy armpits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=beyonce>8. Beyonce</h2><p>Singer <a href=#>Beyonce Knowles</a> looked perfect at the premiere of Cadillac Records in 2008, except for having a few underarm hairs sticking out. She showed up to the event alongside her hubby who also seemed not to notice the&nbsp;hair. A surprised onlooker said, "Beyonce always looks her best at these kind of events." With so much time and energy going into making a celebrity look perfect, sometimes areas get missed or overlooked. Many fans stuck up for the superstar singer, claiming you could barely see her short armpit hair.</p><p></p><h2 id=drew-barrymore>7. Drew Barrymore</h2><p>E.T. star <a href=#>Drew Barrymore</a> has been known to make strong fashion statements. In 2005, she happily rocked out hairy armpits at a New York catwalk event that showcased designer <a href=#>Marc Jacobs</a>. A person in attendance said, "She looked absolutely stunning but all people were talking about backstage were her hairy armpits." Drew was also photographed with hairy armpits while posing on the street with her then boyfriend, clearly not ashamed to be showing off her natural look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=britney-spears>6. Britney Spears</h2><p>At the 31st Annual American Music Awards, pop singer <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> looked dazzling in a glittery cream and green dress. When she lifted her arms up to laugh, cameras captured her armpit stubble. It's unclear whether this was a mistake or not, considering the fact that Britney has been seen going natural on several occasions. Many people believe the pop icon's fashion statements, such as showing off hairy armpits and a shaved head, were connected to her wanting to break free from social norms.</p><p></p><h2 id=kelly-rowland>5. Kelly Rowland</h2><p>Singer <a href=#>Kelly Rowland</a> is considered by many to be a fashion and beauty icon. As a teenager she was thrown into the spotlight, and reached fame as a member of the singing group Destiny's Child. Kelly made a statement at the 2008 InStyle Best Beauty Buys Awards in London after stepping out of a car with hairy armpits. It's unclear if she&nbsp;was trying to send a message to young women about beauty, or simply missed a few spots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=pixie-lott>4. Pixie Lott</h2><p>Singer <a href=#>Pixie Lott</a> normally hits a home run every time she lands on the red carpet. However, that wasn't the case when she attended the London premiere of The Dark Knight Rises in 2012. Each time she lifted her arm to pose for the cameras or wave to fans, it was evident that she forgot to shave under her arms. Even when Pixie simply put her hand on her waist, armpit hairs could still be seen. After the event, she wrote on her Twitter page: "'Ooooopsies a little bit from inbetween waxes hahaha :)."</p><p></p><h2 id=billi-mucklow>3. Billi Mucklow</h2><p>Television star Billi Mucklow was surprised to see a picture of herself with very hairy armpits all over social media. Her boyfriend and famous athlete Andy Carroll posted the image on Instagram, which quickly went viral. Even one of Billi's best friends left a comment making fun of her hairy look. In response, the ex-TOWIE star sent out a tweet, saying: "@AndyTCarroll @giorgiemucklow You's two wait I'm going to get you back!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=scout-willis>2. Scout Willis</h2><p>Scout Willis, the daughter of actors <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a> and <a href=#>Demi Moore</a>, showed off long armpit hair at an art exhibition. As an activist for the Free the Nipple campaign, Scout was also seen without a bra at the event. In 2014, social media went wild after she posted a picture of her working out on Twitter with a full set of armpit hair. One of Scout's followers said, "Your body is great, but please shave your armpits." Her response to that statement: "No thank you!"</p><p></p><h2 id=juliette-lewis>1. Juliette Lewis</h2><p><a href=#>Juliette Lewis</a> is most known for her acting roles in films such as Natural Born Killers and Cape Fear. She was also in a band called The Licks from 2003-2009, which had a solid following. During that time, Juliette was often seen with hairy armpits and a grungy look while performing onstage. The actress-turned-rocker has also posed in front of the cameras on the red carpet, clearly not caring about her hairy armpits getting in the shot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>haaretz.com</a>, <a href=#>mirror.co.uk</a>, <a href=#>azcentral.com</a>, <a href=#>jezebel.com</a>, <a href=#>nydailynews.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2Ysq2xwaxkrKifqcGmsIywoK2gXZ2uqr7YZpirpaCewbR7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-celebs-spotted-with-hairy-armpits.html&text=10%20Celebs%20Spotted%20With%20Hairy%20Armpits&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebs-spotted-with-hairy-armpits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebs-spotted-with-hairy-armpits.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Spotted%20With%20Hairy%20Armpits" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-celebs-spotted-with-hairy-armpits.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Spotted%20With%20Hairy%20Armpits" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebs-spotted-with-hairy-armpits.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Spotted%20With%20Hairy%20Armpits" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebs-spotted-with-hairy-armpits.html&description=10%20Celebs%20Spotted%20With%20Hairy%20Armpits" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10-highest-paid-supermodels-of-all-time-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Highest-Paid Supermodels of All Time, Ranked">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./569787-wz-photo-gallery-of-the-week-recently-retired-wwe-diva-aj-lee.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="WZ Photo Gallery of the Week: Recently Retired WWE Diva AJ Lee">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
