So, early on, Smith was a public figure in rap that rappers, like 50 Cent, who were coming up in the '90s and 2000s could look up to. 2003 was 50 Cent's biggest year with the release of his hit song, In Da Club, and it was also the year fans got one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first photos of Smith and 50 Cent together</a> at the MTV Music Awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, Will Smith and 50 Cent have been good friends, spotted together at movie premieres and red-carpet events.

At first, Jada Pinkett denied August's claims through her reps, saying the allegations, “were not true.” But admitted to the 'entanglement' while on an episode of her show, The Red Table Talk, <a href=#>with Will Smith as a special guest</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the episode dropped, 50 Cent reached out to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Smith in his DMs to check up on him,</a> as any friend would. But the G-Unit rapper didn't receive the kind of response he was expecting. When he asked Smith if he was alright, the Oscar winner replied, “Yes I'm cool. I appreciate your concern, my brother.” The rapper went on to ask him why Jada shared with the world intimate details about their marriage, when Smith responded with, “We broke up, so she did her, and I did me.”</p><p>An eager 50 Cent responded, “Then she said only she can give permission for somebody to blow her back out.” Smith cursed out the rapper, “F*** you 50!” The "Candy Shop" hitmaker said, “Wait, what did I do?” <strong>The rapper then shared the screenshot of their messages on his page with the caption, “Damn, it's like that!”</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/50-cent-s-feud-with-oprah-took-an-awkward-twist-when-the-host-asked-why-he-named-his-dog-after-her.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>50 Cent's Feud With Oprah Took An Awkward Twist When The Host Asked Why He Named His Dog After Her</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>During 50 Cent's interview with Oprah Winfrey, the host confronted the rap artist about his dog's name, which is also Oprah.</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=50-cent-has-insulted-jada-pinkett-smith-several-times-on-social-media>50 Cent Has Insulted Jada Pinkett Smith Several Times On Social Media</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/this-is-how-50-cent-rebuilt-his-net-worth-after-going-bankrupt-front-back-deposite.jpg><p>After the Jada Pinkett Smith's affair with August Alsina, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith appeared to reunite and try to work on their marriage. However, 50 Cent still felt the need to insert himself in his former friend's relationship drama. While at the NBC interview, Pinkett admitted she knew <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she became the “adulterous wife</a>” in the eyes of the public, adding that people assumed she forced her husband of more than 20 years to go to the table [her talk show] and sit there.</p><p>“Now look what she's done. She has the power with an eye roll to make him go up and slap somebody on stage.” Similar to the last time she opened up, <a href=#>Pinkett received a lot of backlash</a> for ‘embarrassing’ Smith every chance she got.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is unclear if this time around, when 50 Cent heard the latest reports about the Oscars incident, whether the rapper reached out to Will Smith personally to inquire about his well-being before going on a social media rant.</p><p><strong>50 Cent posted a series of photos on his official Instagram page calling out Jada Pinkett Smith </strong>after she mentioned legendary rapper 2Pac Shakur asked her to marry him. He shared a meme of Pinkett in the car with the late rapper and captioned it, “Thug Life, Jada in New York looking for Puffy. Lol you think you going to get away with this”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In another post, 50 Cent shared a photo of Will Smith’s wife with the byline, "Jada Pinkett Smith reveals she sold a lot of crack as a teenager." and captioned it, “Alright enough is enough! FREE WILL SMITH! WTF is going on?” Seeing as 50 Cent is still publicly making fun of Will Smith’s wife by starting the Free Will Smith campaign, <strong>50 Cent and Will Smith's friendship is likely non-existent at the moment.</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/a50-cent-eminem.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Friends Forever: A Timeline Of 50 Cent And Eminem's 2 Decades Of Friendship</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Eminem and 50 Cent have a friendship that has lasted for 2 decades, and it continues to remain as strong as ever.</span><h2 id=the-truth-about-jada-pinkett-smith-and-will-smith-marriage>The Truth About Jada Pinkett Smith And Will Smith Marriage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/th-image-template-13.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Will Smith and Jada Pinkett's marriage came back into the limelight during the 2022 Oscars ceremony, when Will Smith went on stage and assaulted Chris Rock.
