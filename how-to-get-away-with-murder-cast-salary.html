For the show’s lead, Rhimes had specifically chosen a season actress in the form of Oscar winner Viola Davis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Viola Davis Channeled Her ‘How To Get Away With Murder’ Character In Epic Oscar’s Moment</a></span></p><p>During the show’s run, Davis received critical acclaim for her portrayal of law professor Annalise Keating (she gave so much to the role, so much so that <a href=#>she broke her back while filming an intimate scene</a>). As expected, Davis also went on to be the highest paid cast member on the show throughout the series. In fact, it was reported that <a href=#>the actress was paid a reported $250,000 per episode</a> (the same rate that Shondaland star Kerry Washington received for her lead role in Scandal). Meanwhile, ever since the report was released, fans also wondered which other HTGAWM cast member was paid the most after Davis.</p><h2 id=the-show-rsquo-s-cast-featured-several-relative-newcomers>The Show’s Cast Featured Several Relative Newcomers</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the show, Davis’ Annalise personally mentors a group of ambitious law students that would go on to work with her throughout the series’ run. And to assemble a cast that would form this group, Rhimes and her team went out in search of some undiscovered talent. Among them was Mexican actress Karla Souza who had mostly worked on Mexican shows and films up till then. Oddly enough, Souza had no idea who Rhimes was around the time she was being considered for the part. “It helped with the audition because I wasn't terrified,” the actress pointed out while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speaking with Refinery 29</a>. “I would have been if I knew what I was going up for.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Aja Naomi King had scored some series regular roles in the past but none of them really stuck. Both the ABC series Black Box and CW’s Emily Owens M.D. got canceled after just one season. By the time HTGAWM came around, King knew she wanted to be a part of it so bad. This was especially the case when she learned that Davis got cast as the series’ lead. “I believe I said I would just die,” the actress remarked during an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with The New York Times</a>. “It’s like: ‘I’m done. That’s all I’ll ever need.’”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Things You Never Noticed In 'How To Get Away With Murder'</a></span></p><p>As for Matt McGorry, he went did a tape audition for the series, not really expecting to get cast. “I was going out for pilots that year,” the actor told Variety. “And I was like, I don’t really think I’m going to book anything.” To the actor’s surprise, he didn’t just end up booking Rhimes’ show. In fact, McGorry would also go on to get cast in the hit <a href=#>Netflix</a> series Orange is the New Black.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=these-two-actors-may-also-be-among-the-top-earners-on-the-show>These Two Actors May Also Be Among The Top Earners On The Show</h2><p>While several actors on the show were relative newcomers, there were several veterans aside from Davis too. And while ABC never released the salary figures for the rest of the cast, it would stand to reason that at least two of these veterans would get paid the most next to Davis since they figure prominently in the series too.</p><p>Prior to getting cast as Annalise’s associate Bonnie Winterbottom, Liza Weil starred in Gilmore Girls and even made appearances in The West Wing and the medical drama ER. Over the years, the actress also appeared in Rhimes’ Grey’s Anatomy, Private Practice, and Scandal. And so, it was time for Weil to finally become a Shondaland series regular. “I’m always down to be a part of anything that is going on in Shondaland,” the actress remarked while speakinglso with Starry Mag. “Going in, I sort of knew it was going to be a big ride and that you were going to be able to do a lot of things and go in all different directions. Nothing is ever off-limits with characters. That’s always very interesting.” At the moment, Weil is estimated to have a net worth of $3 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Viola Davis Is ‘Devastated’ Over Former HTGAWM Co-star Cicely Tyson’s Death</a></span></p><p>On the other hand, one of the actors who was cast as Annalise’s student happens to be Alfred Enoch who previously starred in the Harry Potter franchise. And although he didn’t end up staying on the show all the way till the end (he got killed off), he left quite a impression, especially on Davis herself. “He’s so confident and self-assured. He has such incredible integrity about his art,” Davis told Teen Vogue. “It looks like he’s been around the world and back.” Interestingly, Enoch also happens to have an estimated net worth of $3 million.</p><p>Meanwhile, ever since the show ended, several cast members had gone on to pursue other Hollywood projects. And if they are ever to return to Shondaland, it’s almost certain that they would be getting paid a lot more per episode. Now, fans would just have to wait and see which HTGWM cast member would be appearing in one of Rhimes’ future shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>‘Bridgerton’ Stars In Harry Potter: Fans Freak Out...
