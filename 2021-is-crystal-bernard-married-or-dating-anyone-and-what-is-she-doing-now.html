On average, those with talents, often pick one part of the industry to express their talent. Occasionally, multi-talented people come along and achieve success in two or more subgroups such as Crystal Bernard who is not only an actress with a popular sitcom in her resume but also a singer and a songwriter.</p><p>Crystal Bernard’s multi-medium career has seen her release two albums along with multiple singles. She also has an extensive filmography with over 30 films and television shows to her name. Crystal’s personal life has remained a subject of discussion for a long time with many wondering what her love life looks, is she married or dating anyone? has remained a question many of her fans seek answers to and we will have provided answers to them below.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-humble-background-and-how-she-became-so-famous></span><b>Her Humble Background And How She Became So Famous</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The gorgeous and target driven actress songwriter and singer was born to Dr. Jerry Wayne Bernard and Gaylon Fussell on the 30th of September 1961 in Garland, Texas. Crystal was then raised in Oak Creek Village, Houston alongside her three sisters, Robyn, Scarlett, and Angelique Bernard.</p><p>Crystal may not have spent a lot of time with her father who was a televangelist that traveled around the country preaching the gospel but she picked up one of her father’s talents, singing. She began singing as a child, most of which were gospel songs due to the status of the family as a Southern Baptist church home. She recorded her first songs as early as the age of eight.</p><p>Crystal Bernard’s early inclination to music already established a career path in entertainment for her and she solidified this by attending Baylor University where she studied Acting and International Relations after she graduated from Spring High School. She also attended Alley Theatre in Houston, Texas where she took on further knowledge of acting.</p><p>At the completion of her education, Crystal relocated to Los Angeles where she hoped to kickstart her music career but it was her acting career that took off first. She appeared in her first on-screen role in television in 1982, playing the role of K.C Cunningham in the tenth season of the sitcom, Happy Days. In the same year, she appeared in another television show Gimme a Break! and made her first appearance in a feature-length film, Young Doctors in Love as the character, Julie. Since she broke the ground on her career in 1982, she has starred in multiple projects across both mediums – film, and television.</p><p>Crystal Bernard, over the course of her career, has played many characters but the one she is perhaps most notable for is her role as Helen Chapel in the sitcom, Wings. She played the character between 1990 and 1997, appearing in a total of 172 episodes. Her other television appearances including Meet the Santas (2005), To Love, Honor & Betray (1999), The Secret Path (1999).</p><p>As someone who was completely dedicated to acting as a form of performance art, Bernard did not limit the extent of her talent to the screen. Returning back to the medium where she learned the art, she performed in a couple of stage productions like Crimes of the Heart in 1999 and Barbra’s Wedding in 2005.</p><p>With her acting career in smooth sailing, Crystal Bernard returned to her first love, music. She released her first project, a single, Forever Tonight in 1995, and Have We Forgotten What Love Is in 1996. She has also released two albums – Girl Next Door in 1996 and Don’t Touch Me There in 1999. As a musician, her genre was country music.</p><p>After 26 years in show business, Crystal Bernard retired from the industry in 2008. As part of the brand and career she built as an entertainer, Crystal is the brand ambassador for a bottled water company in Arizona, O Premium Waters.’</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=crystal-bernards-relationship-history-over-the-years></span><strong>Crystal Bernard’s Relationship History Over The Years</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Perhaps her decision to pursue a career in Hollywood, home of liberal culture, may have been the signal that Crystal Bernard’s conservative upbringing did not take, but it most definitely showed in her personal life. Raised in a Christian home, anyone would have thought that Crystal Bernard believed in the sacredness of the marriage institution and would uphold it but the beautiful actress seems not to be interested in the institution at all. She has however been in a few relationships.</p><p>Over the years, she dated Grammy Award-winning producer Michael Shipley, although the pair were never vocal about their love life, their time together, how they met, and all of the other info, fans would have loved to be let on into. Their relationship ended in a few years and she was with Tony Thomas. Her relationship with Tony although lasted a little bit longer than others also went in the way o the previous.</p><p>It was later rumored that she had also dated Rush Limbaugh that was in the late 1990s and that the relationship had collapsed because they were both too busy pursuing their career that had less time to nurture it. In 2004, she was spotted with Billy Dean, and rumors had it that they had a thing going but that was also short-lived, she currently appears to be single at the moment, until she states otherwise</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-current-relationship-status-remains-a-mystery></span> <strong>Her Current Relationship Status</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Remains A Mystery</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Crystal Bernard was recently rumored to have secretly tied the knots with Peter Cetera. Bernard and the U.S songwriter and bassist performed a duet with far back in 1995; that over twenty-five years after.&nbsp; Considering the fact that Cetera has been married and divorced twice, there is actually a probability that the duo found love in each other’s arms after a long time this has not been confirmed as either party has confirmed nor refuted the rumor.</p><p>Thus, we can tentatively state that the actor-singer has never been married and doesn’t seem to be interested in one or possibly keeping it away from us all.</p><p><strong style="font-family:open sans,arial,sans-serif;font-size:27px;letter-spacing:-.02em">Here’s What She Has Been Up To Since Her Retirement&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Crystal Bernard has lived a life away from the media and its paparazzi ever since she retired from the showbiz industry in 2008. She has not recently been spotted socializing or attending events.</p><p>https://twitter.com/PierceEmilie/status/1244371855827521542</p><p>She has a Facebook account where she last made a post in 2009 and a twitter handle @CrystalBernard1 where she retweeted Pierce Emilie’s post announcing David Aka Roy’s death in March 2020.
