The world-renowned singer-songwriter has an extensive discography and several awards thanks to his decades-long career. Throughout the years of his powerhouse fame, Elton John has collaborated with a plethora of other iconic stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth Behind Elton John And Britney Spears' Collaboration</a></span></p><p>Some of them have been predictable, some of them have been surprising, and some were so unexpected that even the most dedicated of Elton John fans were surprised. Elton John has collaborated with hit pop stars from his generation to generation Z. Here is a look at this extensive history of collaboration.</p><h2 id=luciano-pavarotti---live-like-horses><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Luciano Pavarotti - Live Like Horses</span></h2><p>Elton John's collaborations cross generations and genres. He has done duets with rappers, pop stars, and Opera singers. In 1996, Elton John recorded "Live Like Horses," a song which was also the album's name, with Luciano Pavarotti, one of the greatest opera singers of the 20th century and a member of The Three Tenors. The song was featured on the soundtrack of a 2019 film about Pavarotti's life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dua-lipa---cold-heart><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Dua Lipa - Cold Heart</span></h2><p>Dua Lipa might have helped cement Elton John with a Gen Z fandom with their collaboration on "Cold Heart." The song is rather unique because it utilizes a popular medium in modern music, sampling. But while most artists sample songs from other artists, the song is a combination of samples from four of Elton John's biggest hits; "Rocket Man”, “Sacrifice," “Kiss the Bride," and “Where's the Shoorah?” The song is one of Elton John's biggest hits in the last 25 years.</p><h2 id=stevie-wonder---finish-line><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Stevie Wonder - Finish Line</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>2022 was a big year for Elton John collaborations. Not only did he record "Cold Hearts" with Dua Lipa, he also recorded "Finish Line" with Stevie Wonder. The pair have been friends for years and the official music video for the song shows nostalgic pictures and clips of the duo throughout the years. It sends the message, "We will cross the finish line of life together, my friend."</p><h2 id=young-thug-and-nicki-minaj---always-love-you><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Young Thug and Nicki Minaj - Always Love You</span></h2><p>A collaboration with Stevie Wonder is something one might expect from Elton John, both are piano players and prominent solo artists. But a collaboration with Young Thug and Nicki Minaj? Two of the biggest rappers in the game? Well, it happened. The song is called "Always Love You," and it came out in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Cardi B Vs. Nicki Minaj: Where The Feud Stands As Of 2022</a></span></p><h2 id=kiki-dee---don-39-t-go-breaking-my-heart><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kiki Dee - Don't Go Breaking My Heart</span></h2><p>Kiki Dee's collaboration with Elton John on the song "Don't Go Breaking My Heart," might be one of the most famous duets ever. It is also arguably Elton John's most popular. The song hit number one on both the U.K. and American charts and it remains a go-to song for karaoke nights everywhere.</p><h2 id=rupaul---don-39-t-go-breaking-my-heart><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>RuPaul - Don't Go Breaking My Heart</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RuPaul sings? One might be asking. Yes, he does, and quite beautifully. That is why he and Elton John, both LGBTQ icons, dueted for a second rendition of Elton's hit with Kiki Dee. The song was featured on Elton's album Duets which came out in 1993.</p><h2 id=k-d-lang-amp-lulu---teardrops><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>k.d. Lang & Lulu - Teardrops</span></h2><p>Lang recorded "Teardrops" with Elton John in 1993. Their version is one of the many covers of the song which was originally written by Womack and Womack in 1988. Elton John recorded a second cover of the "Teardrops" with British pop icon Lulu for her 2002 album Together.</p><h2 id=leonard-cohen---born-to-lose><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Leonard Cohen - Born To Lose</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cohen has done his fair share of duets throughout his career too, so it was only to be expected that eventually, he'd record a track with Elton. The pair recorded a cover of "Born To Lose" a popular Ray Charles song that has also been covered by Eric Clapton and Tom Jones.</p><h2 id=little-richard---the-power><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Little Richard - The Power</span></h2><p>Little Richard is considered by many to be one of the founders of Rock and Roll. His flair for presentation and his high-pitched "woohoo" throughout the years have gotten many people up and dancing. It is only fitting that someone who personified the "power" of early rock and roll would be utilized for Elton John's track "The Power" in 1993.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Elton John Narrowly Escapes Terrifying Plane Crash</a></span></p><h2 id=everyone-on-the-album-duets><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Everyone On The Album Duets</span></h2><p>Many of the names on this list were part of Elton John's 1993 album Duets, in addition to those mentioned here, Little Richard, Leonard Cohen, k.d. Lang, and Ru Paul, there was; "When I Think About Love" with P.M. Dawn, "Shaky Ground" with Don Henley, "True Love" with Kiki Dee, "If You Were Me" with Chris Rea, "A Woman's Needs" with Tammy Wynette, "Old Friend" with Nik Kershaw, "Go on and On" with Gladys Knight, "Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing" with Marcella Detroit, "I'm Your Puppet" with Paul Young, "Love Letters" with Bonnie Raitt, and "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me" with George Michael.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-cyrus---nothing-else-matters><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Miley Cyrus - Nothing Else Matters</span></h2><p>Unlike the rest of this list, this was a track where Elton John was a <a href=#>featured artist,</a> not the headliner. Cyrus recorded "Nothing Else Matters" in 2021 and it features Elton John, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, Robert Trujillo, and Chad Smith.</p><h2 id=olivia-newton-john---candle-in-the-wind><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Olivia Newton-John - Candle In The Wind</span></h2><p>Olivia Newton-John died in 2022 but she left an immense legacy of iconic performances. In addition to Grease, her most famous role, she had a TV special in the 1980s called Hollywood Nights. There, she and Elton John performed a rendition of "Candle In The Wind" <a href=#>which is still talked about today</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eminem---stan><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Eminem - Stan</span></h2><p>Eminem is often criticized for his lyrics being problematic, but that did not bother Elton John who gladly performed with Eminem at the 2001 Grammys playing piano as Eminem sang "Stan" one of his hits from Curtain Call. The performance sparked <a href=#>an unlikely friendship</a> between the two that goes on to this day. Elton John, who struggled with drugs and alcohol, <a href=#>is Eminem's sponsor </a>and helped the rapper on his road to sobriety.</p><h2 id=britney-spears---hold-me-closer><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Britney Spears - Hold Me Closer</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like his song with Dua Lipa, Elton sampled some of his oldest hits, namely "Tiny Dancer" in order to come out with "Hold Me Closer." The song quickly hit the top of the charts and it <a href=#>marks Spear's official return</a> to the top since winning her conservatorship court battle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irnq0wMCrZJ6ulad6uLTOZp%2Baq12YvK24wJumq5mkmrFuw8itn2adnKm8r3nJqJ%2BnZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fevery-star-ever-who-has-collaborated-with-elton-john.html&text=Every%20Star%20Ever%20Who%20Has%20Collaborated%20With%20Elton%20John&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevery-star-ever-who-has-collaborated-with-elton-john.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevery-star-ever-who-has-collaborated-with-elton-john.html&title=Every%20Star%20Ever%20Who%20Has%20Collaborated%20With%20Elton%20John" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fevery-star-ever-who-has-collaborated-with-elton-john.html&title=Every%20Star%20Ever%20Who%20Has%20Collaborated%20With%20Elton%20John" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fevery-star-ever-who-has-collaborated-with-elton-john.html&title=Every%20Star%20Ever%20Who%20Has%20Collaborated%20With%20Elton%20John" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevery-star-ever-who-has-collaborated-with-elton-john.html&description=Every%20Star%20Ever%20Who%20Has%20Collaborated%20With%20Elton%20John" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fr-michael-king-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-132351-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fr Michael King Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./elon-musk-grimes-breakup-amber-heard.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elon Musk Spotted With Grimes After Breakup With Amber Heard">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
