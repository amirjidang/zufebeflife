We'll take a look at what DJ had to say, along with taking a look back at how the two actors got along during DJ's film debut back in 2001 with The Mummy Returns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brendan-fraser-had-a-tough-time-during-the-shoot-for-the-mummy-returns>Brendan Fraser Had A Tough Time During The Shoot For The Mummy Returns</h2><p>Brendan Fraser was and clearly still is, a huge box office attraction, especially in the early 2000s. Fraser starred in The Mummy Returns, which made a huge impression at the box office, bringing in $435 million.</p><p>At the time of the film, Fraser revealed things weren't exactly easy, <a href=#>especially when it came to the stunts and prepping for the movie</a>. "There was a lot of preparation involved... weights, high protein dieting, the works. In the script where it says Rick gets thrown across the room, then I did, and sort of got smashed up in the process," he said alongside Cinema back in 2001.</p><p>Not only that, Fraser almost lost his life during a particular stunt, that saw the actor struggle with a rope around his throat area.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>What Brendan Fraser Has Said About A Possible ‘Mummy’ Sequel</a></span></p><p>Looking back at the film alongside Popverse, <a href=#>the actor revealed that he had a blast on-set</a>, calling the project a 'real-life adventure'.</p><p>"I really enjoyed getting to be with that whole cast. I loved being part of a movie that we didn't know if it was an action, comedy, horror, adventure, romance. All of the above. We didn't know what we had on our hands, and there was a certain sense of liberty and excitement about it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was an old property that Universal had. The time it came out, you know, it was laughable. Everybody thought of Abbott and Costello—with the mummy. And here we were with our version of it. Courtesy of John Burton, ILM bringing state of the art CGI, and just the combination of all that made it, I'd say, the memorable film that it is now."</p><p>Little did Fraser know at the time, he was working alongside an actor that would become one of the biggest names in all of Hollywood...</p><h2 id=brendan-fraser-was-blown-away-by-dwayne-johnson-s-popularity-during-his-debut-in-the-mummy-returns>Brendan Fraser Was Blown Away By Dwayne Johnson's Popularity During His Debut In The Mummy Returns</h2><p>It should not come as a surprise, Johnson and Fraser completely hit it off during their time together in The Mummy Returns. Johnson credits Fraser for kick-starting his career.</p><p>As for Fraser, he spoke about their time together on the film. According to the actor, <a href=#>he was blown away by Dwayne Johnson's level of popularity back then</a>, given that he was making his acting debut in the film.</p><p>Brendan told Cinema, "The minute we landed, all I heard were these chants. People who didn't speak English were screaming, 'Rock! Rock!' No one cared about me." "He might be the Rock.

Not only that, but he received lots of love from his peers, including you guessed it, Dwayne Johnson.</p><p>"Man, this makes me so happy to see this beautiful ovation for Brendan,” Johnson wrote. “He supported me coming into his ‘Mummy Returns’ franchise for my first ever role, which kicked off my Hollywood career.
