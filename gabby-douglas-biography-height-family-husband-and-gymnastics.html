However, her scores did not count towards winning the competition because she was an alternate.</p><p>Later in March, she was part of the gold-winning U.S. team at the Pacific Rim Championships, where she also won gold in uneven bars.</p><p>At the 2012 U.S. National Championships in June, Douglas won the gold medal in uneven bars, silver in the all-around, and bronze in the floor. Márta Károlyi, the National Team Coordinator for USA Gymnastics, nicknamed Douglas the “Flying Squirrel” for her aerial performance on the uneven bars.</p><p><strong>2012 Summer Olympic Games</strong><br>At the 2012 Olympic Trials held in San Jose, California on July 1, Douglas placed first in the all-around rankings, securing the only guaranteed spot on the women’s Olympic gymnastics team.</p><p>At the 2012 Summer Olympics gymnastics event at the O2 Arena (North Greenwich Arena) in London, Douglas and her teammates – Weiber, McKayla Maroney, captain Aly Raisman and Kyla Ross (collectively nicknamed the “Fierce Five”), won the team event gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics – the first since the “Magnificent Seven”, including Shannon Miller, Dominique Moceanu, Kerri Strug, and Dominique Dawes, did so as hosts in Atlanta in 1996.</p><p>Douglas was the only gymnast on the team to compete on all four apparatus (vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise) during the qualifying round and during the finals of the team competition. She then won the gold medal in the individual all-around, becoming the first African-American woman, as well as the first woman of color of any nationality, to win the event.</p><p>She also became the fourth American woman to win Olympic all-around gold as well as the third straight to do so (after Mary Lou Retton in Los Angeles in 1984, Carly Patterson in Athens in 2004 and Nastia Liukin in Beijing in 2008, all of whom were at the venue and watched Douglas equal their feat.) She also became the first American gymnast ever to win both the team and individual all-around gold at the same Olympics.</p><p>Douglas finished eighth in uneven bars, and seventh on the balance beam. She is the first all-around champion to fail to medal in an individual event since women’s gymnastics was added to the Olympics in 1952.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gabby-douglas-house></span>Gabby Douglas House<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-mce-type=bookmark style=width:0;overflow:hidden;line-height:0 class=mce_SELRES_start></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=timothy-douglas-gabby-douglas></span>Timothy Douglas Gabby Douglas<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her father is called Timothy&nbsp;Douglas.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gabby-douglas-accomplishments></span>Gabby Douglas Accomplishments<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gabby trained with coach Laing Chow.

Gabby took uneven bars title at the 2010 Pan American championships.</p><p>In one competition she placed fifth all-around and won her a share of the U.S. team gold medal. U.S. team won the gold medal in the team finals at the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Tokyo, Japan. She also won the 2012 Olympic Trials, which took place in San Jose, California. She was selected to the national team that will represent the United States at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England.</p><p>2012 16-year-old Douglas had proven herself a champion. Going from a&nbsp;beginner gymnast&nbsp;to Olympian in a short time. She became the subject of significant media attention in the summer of 2012 was featured&nbsp;on the cover of a&nbsp;magazine.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gabby-douglas-retired></span>Gabby Douglas Retired<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>U.S. gymnast Gabby Douglas was the star of the 2012 London games, becoming the first African American gymnast to ever win gold in both the team and individual all-around at the same Olympics. But, in 2016, Douglas’ Olympic experience didn’t go as smoothly in Rio De Janeiro. Unfortunately, she failed to qualify for the individual all-around competition and then finished seventh overall in the uneven bars final.</p><p>To add to this, she was also criticized on social media for not placing her hand over her heart during the playing of the U.S. national anthem and later for not appearing to support her teammates Simon Biles and Aly Raisman during their all-around final events.</p><p>Douglas stated…”I have no regrets coming back for a second Olympic team,” she said after the uneven bars final. “It’s been an amazing experience. It’s been teaching me a lot.”</p><p>Douglas walked away from Rio with a gold for the team all-around event for the second time in a row. Since gymnasts typically retire young, Douglas is not expected to return to the Tokyo games in 2020.</p><p>Unfortunately, I also believe it is true the Douglas will not return to the 2020 Olympics. Sometimes gymnasts that train at the Olympic level get burnt out, resulting in them only being able to compete in one or two Olympic games. I do believe Douglas was burnt out in the 2016 games, so its highly unlikely she will be returning to the 2020 games in Tokyo. What do you guys believe? Do you agree that Douglas is officially retired and not returning to try and make the 2020 Olympics?</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-gabby-douglas-what-is-gabby-douglas-doing-now></span>What Happened To Gabby Douglas |&nbsp;What Is Gabby Douglas Doing Now<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=%ef%bb%bfgabby-douglas-college></span> <span data-mce-type=bookmark style=width:0;overflow:hidden;line-height:0 class=mce_SELRES_start></span>Gabby Douglas College<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At the age of eight, Douglas won the Level 4 all-around gymnastics title at the 2004 Virginia State Championships.

In 2010—at age 14—she left her family and moved in with a host family in West Des Moines, Iowa, where she started training with prominent coach Liang Chow.</p><p>Douglas soon began to attract attention at national competitions—she finished fourth in the all-around event at the 2010 Nastia Liukin Supergirl Cup, and at the 2011 Visa Championships, she tied for third on the uneven bars and placed seventh all-around.</p><p>She was named to the senior national team and helped the United States earn the team gold at the 2011 world championships, where she also placed fifth on the uneven bars. Douglas’s skill on the uneven bars—specifically, her ability to gain extraordinary height in the air when releasing from the apparatus—led U.S. team coordinator Martha Karolyi to dub her “the Flying Squirrel,” a nickname that Douglas and her coterie of fans embraced.</p><p>At the 2012 Visa Championships, Douglas narrowly lost the all-around gold to Jordyn Wieber, the reigning world and national all-around champion. In addition to taking the all-around silver medal, Douglas claimed gold on the uneven bars and bronze in the floor exercise. Weeks later, at the U.S. Olympic trials, Douglas narrowly edged out Wieber to claim the all-around title.</p><p>With the victory, Douglas secured an automatic berth on the Olympic team. In London Douglas and her teammates—Wieber, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and Kyla Ross—captured the first U.S. women’s team gold medal since 1996.</p><p>Douglas then competed in the all-around event, posting strong scores during each rotation to finish with the top overall score. Douglas also competed individually on the balance beam and the uneven bars but did not medal in either event, finishing in seventh and eighth place, respectively. Her memoir Grace, Gold, and Glory: My Leap of Faith (co-written with Michelle Burford) was released in 2012.</p><p>Douglas took two years off from competitive gymnastics before returning to the U.S. national team in November 2014. At the 2015 artistic gymnastics world championships, she won a gold medal in the team event and a silver in the all-around. The following year she won team gold at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games but failed to win an individual medal.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gabby-douglas-coach></span>Gabby Douglas Coach<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her gym instructor is called Liang Chow.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gabby-douglas-facebook></span>Gabby Douglas Facebook<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gabby-douglas-twitter></span>Gabby Douglas Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gabby-douglas-instagram></span>Gabby Douglas Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h1 style=text-align:center>Gabby Douglas News</h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gabby-douglas-olympic-champion-reveals-abuse-by-usa-team-doctor-larry-nassar></span>Gabby Douglas: Olympic champion reveals abuse by USA team doctor Larry Nassar<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=updated-on-22-november-2017></span>Updated on: 22 November 2017<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Gabby Douglas has become the third member of the USA’s London 2012 Olympic gold medal-winning team to say she was abused by team doctor Larry Nassar.</p><p>Douglas, 21, had been accused of blaming victims last week, after saying that women should “dress modestly” to avoid enticing “the wrong crowd”.</p><p>She apologized for the comments, which came after team-mate Aly Raisman revealed she was abused by Nassar.</p><p>And a representative has since confirmed Douglas was also a victim.</p><p>Team-mate McKayla Maroney, who was part of the ‘fierce five’ who won gold in London, has also come forward to say she had been molested by Nassar.</p><p>In a statement posted on Instagram, captioned ‘please hear my heart’, Douglas offered support to her team-mates and said: “I didn’t publicly share my experiences as well as many other things because for years we were conditioned to stay silent and some things were extremely painful.”</p><p>Nassar was involved with the USA team for nearly three decades and worked with the gymnasts at four Olympic Games.</p><p>He is due in court on Wednesday, having pleaded guilty to child pornography charges, and is reportedly set to be jailed for 25 years under a deal agreed with prosecutors over 22 criminal sexual misconduct charges he is facing.</p><p>Nassar’s case was part of a scandal which saw USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny resign last year.

I think those are the best moments — when you fall and get back up and keep pushing.”</p><p>Douglas’ words encapsulated the two apparent elements of her character — her humility and love for her family. She was inspired to become a gymnast by her older sister, who had already developed the hobby.</p><p>“My older sister was a gymnast before I was,” Douglas said. “She did gymnastics and when I was younger, I was like, ‘I want to do what you’re doing.’”</p><p>However, her mother was not quite so eager to send Douglas down the same path as her sister, who had already injured her wrist twice in the intense sport.</p><p>“It took her about four years to finally put me in, but then I fell in love the first day of gymnastics,” Douglas said.</p><p>It was the hesitant approval from her mother that led Douglas to become the first African-American in Olympic history to win gold in both the gymnastic individual all-around and team competitions at the same Olympic games, accomplishing such greatness in the London games of 2012.</p><p>When asked further about her family’s role in her career, Douglas beamed with enthusiasm over their support.</p><p>“They were so amazing throughout the whole journey,” she said. “They were there with me until the end and I love them so much. There was never any jealousy, never any envy. All-day long, they supported me and poured so much into my career. At the end of the day, I can say I’m so grateful to have a family like them.”</p><p>As with any career, Douglas said that she faced some challenges, especially while living as an African-American female playing such a competitive sport in the public eye.</p><p>“For so long, people were telling me that I couldn’t do it, it was way too much, and I would never make it,” Douglas said. “Unfortunately, I listened to those haters and doubters and actually wanted to quit gymnastics before the Olympics.”</p><p>Now that she has learned her lesson and proven those haters wrong, she encouraged the audience to block negative comments out and push forward to one’s goals.</p><p>“Never let anyone determine your talent and your success,” she said. “At the end of the day, you know what you can do, so just go out there and do it. Don’t listen to the negative comments and the haters — if you know you can do it, then go for it.”</p><p>After the audience broke into applause, the interviewer, junior finance major Martins Osasuwen, who serves as an associate member of the College Union Board, fittingly stated, “to family.”</p><p>“Yes,” Douglas said smiling. “To family.”</p><p><strong>Source: TCNJ Signal</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BRl6%2B6ecOorKCkkah6o7XOoKmaqJiueqmxyKCfrWWWlrqquNhmn66rkpa7pXnAp5tmn6miu6K%2F06KarGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgabby-douglas-biography-height-family-husband-and-gymnastics.html&text=Gabby%20Douglas%20Biography%2c%20Height%2c%20Family%2c%20Husband%20and%20Gymnastics&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgabby-douglas-biography-height-family-husband-and-gymnastics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgabby-douglas-biography-height-family-husband-and-gymnastics.html&title=Gabby%20Douglas%20Biography%2c%20Height%2c%20Family%2c%20Husband%20and%20Gymnastics" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgabby-douglas-biography-height-family-husband-and-gymnastics.html&title=Gabby%20Douglas%20Biography%2c%20Height%2c%20Family%2c%20Husband%20and%20Gymnastics" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgabby-douglas-biography-height-family-husband-and-gymnastics.html&title=Gabby%20Douglas%20Biography%2c%20Height%2c%20Family%2c%20Husband%20and%20Gymnastics" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgabby-douglas-biography-height-family-husband-and-gymnastics.html&description=Gabby%20Douglas%20Biography%2c%20Height%2c%20Family%2c%20Husband%20and%20Gymnastics" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-did-elviss-mother-die-elviss-fame-contributed-to-her-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How did Elviss mother die?
