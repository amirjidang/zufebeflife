It’s been seven long years since Gossip Girl&nbsp;stopped filming, and the withdrawal symptoms haven’t stopped yet. Though the world has plenty of teen drama <a href=#>TV series</a>, none have enticed us quite as much as GG did. Even if we don’t buy GG’s real identity for a second.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Cast Member Of The Crown's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>The cast of the show have since gone on to do other things, most of them continuing their acting careers and branching out into other genres. Some of the cast have made headlines for other reasons too! Keep reading to find out every cast member of Gossip Girl’s <a href=#>net worth</a>.</p><h2 id=blake-lively-6-million>Blake Lively: $6 Million</h2><p><a href=#>Blake Lively</a> played Serena van der Woodsen, arguably the most iconic of all the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gossip Girl</a>&nbsp;characters. Serena is the perfect it-girl who messes up time and time again and yet always lands on her feet. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Blake Lively has a net worth of $16 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since finishing up with Gossip Girl, Lively has undertaken a number of projects. Recently, she appeared in the thriller A Simple Favor alongside Anna Kendrick and Henry Golding, where she played two evil twins caught up in a web of lies.</p><h2 id=leighton-meester-5-million>Leighton Meester: $5 Million</h2><p>The other main star of the Upper East Side is Blair Waldorf, the conniving and somewhat <a href=#>spoiled daughter </a>of a NYC fashion designer. Blair’s friendship with Serena is tumultuous over the course of the show, but the two end up as BFFs. And we all know that the Blair relationship we’re really interested in is that between Blair and Chuck, affectionately known as Chair.</p><p>Leighton Meester, who played Blair, is worth around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$5 million</a>. These days she’s married to another former teen drama star: Adam Brody of The O.C.&nbsp;fame.</p><h2 id=ed-westwick-4-million>Ed Westwick: $4 Million</h2><p>Perhaps the most complex character on the show, Chuck Bass starts out as the villain that you want to see disappear forever and ends up being the primary reason that viewers continued to tune in every week. Although Chuck does some terrible things, he redeems himself through his relationship with Blair and overcoming the wounds his father carved into him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With a net worth of around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4 million</a>, Ed Westwick has done some other projects since the end of Gossip Girl. Between 2017 and 2019, he appeared in the TV series White Gold&nbsp;as Vincent Swan.</p><h2 id=penn-badgley-8-million>Penn Badgley: $8 Million</h2><p>Penn Badgley is one former GG star who has made headlines recently thanks to his work in Netflix’s You. In the creepy thriller, Badgley shows off his acting range that stretches from dorky and adorable to downright unsettling. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, he is worth about $8 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Cast Member Of Brooklyn Nine-Nine's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Dan Humphrey is the outsider of the GG gang, so most people were shocked to discover the big reveal at the end of the series. We still don’t buy that Dan was Gossip Girl all along. It would have made more sense for it to have been Dorota!</p><h2 id=chace-crawford-6-million>Chace Crawford: $6 Million</h2><p>Playing the super handsome and charming Nate Archibald was Chase Crawford, who is currently worth about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$6 million</a>. Nate’s storylines always tend to take a backseat to those of Blair, Chuck, and Serena, but how can you not love him? For a spoiled and privileged kid, he is so pure of heart!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Crawford has appeared in a few acting projects since finishing up with GG, including 2012’s What to Expect When You’re Expecting, where he acted opposite Anna Kendrick. In 2019, he appeared in The Boys&nbsp;TV series as The Deep.</p><h2 id=taylor-momsen-4-million>Taylor Momsen: $4 Million</h2><p>Little J a.k.a. Jenny Humphrey&nbsp;probably undergoes the biggest character transformation from the beginning of the series to the end. She gets caught up in the wrong crowd, turns her back on the people that matter, and eventually leaves town. Taylor Momsen doesn’t appear in the last few seasons of the show, save for a small cameo in the finale.</p><p>The former child star (you might remember her from The Grinch!) is worth about $4 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Biography.</a> The 26-year-old is also a rock star, fronting the group The Pretty Reckless.</p><h2 id=michelle-trachtenberg-9-million>Michelle Trachtenberg: $9 Million</h2><p>No GG character irritated viewers quite as much as Georgina Sparks. Even though she has moments where she redeems herself, she’s still ultimately one of the show’s most annoying villains that you love to hate. Michelle Trachtenberg portrayed her brilliantly. She’s worth every cent of that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$9 million</a>!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is Us: Every Cast Member's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Tratchenberg has a list of other impressive acting credits to her name, including Ice Princess, which she appeared in before doing GG, and 17 Again. Since GG, she has appeared in a few TV shows and films, including Sleepy Hollow and Guidance.</p><h2 id=kelly-rutherford-1-million>Kelly Rutherford: $1 Million</h2><p>Kelly Rutherford portrayed the super sophisticated and privileged Lily Bass, the mother of Serena and Eric van der Woodsen. Lily is another character that undergoes quite a transformation on the show, starting as a self-absorbed mom who’s more concerned with what people think of her than the wellbeing of her kids. By the end, she becomes one of the most endearing characters.</p><p>Rutherford is worth around $1 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. In 2019, she appeared in Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists&nbsp;TV series, and also guest-starred in one episode of Jane the Virgin.</p><h2 id=matthew-settle-4-million>Matthew Settle: $4 Million</h2><p>Rufus Humphrey is the stark opposite to the other parents of the Upper East Side. Even when he moves into Lily’s extravagant apartment, he keeps the down-to-earth coolness that makes him one of the most popular characters on the show. Matthew Settle, who does a great job of portraying Rufus, has a net worth of about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of GG who saw the 1998 slasher thriller I Still Know What You Did Last Summer might not realize that it was a much younger Settle playing the villain’s son, Will Benson.</p><h2 id=jessica-szohr-4-million>Jessica Szohr: $4 Million</h2><p>Some fans love Vanessa Abrams, while others hate her. Some love seeing her with Dan, others love seeing her with Nate, and others wish she’d just go back to Brooklyn. Jessica Szohr did an amazing job portraying Dan’s grounded best friend—one of the only characters on the entire show with any morals. Sources state that she’s worth approximately <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4 million</a>.</p><p>Between 2017 and 2018, Szohr <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared in</a> Shameless&nbsp;as Nessa&nbsp;and has also starred in a range of other acting projects since completing her time on Gossip Girl.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Game Of Thrones: Net Worth Of Every Actor</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS0sL%2FSoqdmn5mnuW6vwKyrZpmTqbyzv4yamq2qlajApr%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgossip-girl-cast-actors-actresses-net-worth.html&text=Every%20Cast%20Member%20Of%20Gossip%20Girls%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgossip-girl-cast-actors-actresses-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgossip-girl-cast-actors-actresses-net-worth.html&title=Every%20Cast%20Member%20Of%20Gossip%20Girls%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgossip-girl-cast-actors-actresses-net-worth.html&title=Every%20Cast%20Member%20Of%20Gossip%20Girls%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgossip-girl-cast-actors-actresses-net-worth.html&title=Every%20Cast%20Member%20Of%20Gossip%20Girls%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgossip-girl-cast-actors-actresses-net-worth.html&description=Every%20Cast%20Member%20Of%20Gossip%20Girls%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gerard-depardieu-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gerard Depardieu Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./emily-deschanel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emily Deschanel News - Us Weekly">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
