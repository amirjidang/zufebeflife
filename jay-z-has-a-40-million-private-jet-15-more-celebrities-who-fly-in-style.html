Sure there are a lot of people out there that have a fancy car, in fact, there are a lot of celebrities out there that have all sorts of fancy cars, but that doesn't come close to touching a private jet. There are celebrities that own big fancy mansions&nbsp;— maybe even a bunch of big fancy mansions&nbsp;— some of them even own islands! But once again, that doesn't even scratch the surface of how cool it is to own a private jet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's look at Jay-Z, for example — you might give him a hard time about a lot of things, but one thing's for sure, you aren't going to give him a hard time about his Bombardier Challenger 850 Learjet. That thing proves that he's quite the baller. It's worth $40 million, can seat 15 passengers, and had a kitchen, a bedroom, a cream-leather living room, and two bathrooms. Jay-Z isn't the only one that is flying around in style, though, there are many&nbsp;celebrities that are cruising around in private jets&nbsp;— and no Andy Dick is not on the list. Still, though, I'm sure some of these are going to surprise you. Here are 15 celebrities other than Jay-Z who fly in style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie><strong>Angelina Jolie</strong></h2><p>Angelina Joli is one of the most famous actresses of our time, and not only that she is also a huge celebrity, mostly because of her marriage and then break up, with Brad Pitt&nbsp;— although being ridiculously hot and a pretty good actress probably have something to do with it, too. Whether you think Angelina Jolie is cool or not, you have to admit it is not only cool to have a private jet, but it's also pretty rad that she can fly it herself. She has had&nbsp;her license for a long time and owns a&nbsp;Cirrus SR22. Even though her personal life has really been having some bumps in the road as of late, at least she can&nbsp;fly off by herself and get some quiet time in the air in her private plane.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise><strong>Tom Cruise&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>I have to admit, if there's one guy that I would imagine would have a private plane it would be Tom Cruise, and not just because he was in&nbsp;Top Gun,&nbsp;the guy just looks like a pilot somehow.&nbsp; Whether you like him or not, Tom Cruise is one of the most famous and most successful actors of his generation, and apparently, he is a pretty good pilot, too. Apparently, he "is now the proud owner of five private jets, including a Gulfstream IV with a maximum range of 7,820km and a cruising speed of Mach 0.80." That is pretty impressive, but I have to say, when Tom Cruise gets excited, he tends to act a little odd from time to time. Here's hoping he keeps it together when he is up there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jim-carrey><strong>Jim Carrey</strong></h2><p>Jim Carrey is not the kind of guy that you would expect to be cruising around in a private plane. Yes, he is obviously rich, and for a long time, he was one of the very biggest stars in Hollywood, with roles in movies such as&nbsp;Dumb and Dumber,&nbsp;even though his career has kind of fallen off lately. But he has a jet all right. He owns a $59-million Gulfstream, which can hold around 16 passengers. Seriously? This guy spent $60 million on his own plane? It is apparent that Jim Carrey has more money then he knows what to do with, and more power to him. He has always been hilarious, and maybe we will&nbsp;be seeing more of him so if he feels like working.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oprah-winfrey><strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong></h2><p>If you think of one single female celebrity out there that might have a private plane then you would probably guess that it might be Oprah Winfrey. Oprah is obviously incredibly wealthy, so it doesn't surprise&nbsp;us a lot that she has her own plane. When you have money like she does, the whole thing only makes sense. Why go wait in line at the airport if you can fly yourself? She has a&nbsp;Global Express XRS Jet, which seats about 10 passengers. It just goes to show you how much someone can achieve with a lot of hard work. Her show has been incredibly popular for a long time and it shows no signs of slowing down.</p><h2 id=mark-zuckerberg><strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong></h2><p>All right, obviously Mark Zuckerberg, the guy that is the main owner of Facebook, is incredibly rich. In fact, his next worth is now $72 billion. When you have that much money, it probably isn't that much of a stretch to think about buying a private plane. It would be like you or me going to the store and buying a slice of pizza. So does it surprise you at all that he has a private jet?&nbsp;The only thing that would surprise me would be if he didn't have ten of them. Maybe if you friended Mark on Facebook he would give you a ride on his jet — you never know. Although, I'm pretty sure he gets a lot of friend requests.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harrison-ford><strong>Harrison Ford</strong></h2><p>It makes me happy that Harrison Ford is on this list. As Han Solo in&nbsp;Star Wars,&nbsp;he was one of the coolest fictional pilots of all time, so it is nice to know that he also can handle that role in real life. He owns all sorts of planes including an Aviat A-1B Husky, DHC-2 Beaver, Cessna 182, Beechcraft B36TC Bonanza, Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, 929-vintage Waco Taperwing, and a Bell 407 helicopter. There is no word on whether or not Chewbacca accompanies him on any of his flights. Seriously though, that is really an impressive bunch of planes, but hey, this is Harrison Ford we are talking about, he can get away with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tiger-woods><strong>Tiger Woods</strong></h2><p>If you are Tiger Woods, then you probably want to have a private plane so you can get away quickly if the paparazzi&nbsp;— or angry women— find you. He owns&nbsp;a Gulfstream G550, which goes to show you what fame and riches are really all about. Sure, he's become a bit of a disgrace, and while he was once a hero to many, he is now a punchline. But when it comes right down to it, the guy still has a private plane. Do you have a private plane? I know that I don't. Tiger is still trying to make a comeback at age 42. Come on Tiger, you have accomplished&nbsp;so much already and you are totally rich&nbsp;— go fly your plane someplace nice and relax for a while.</p><h2 id=steven-spielberg><strong>Steven Spielberg</strong></h2><p>When you are a guy that has directed,&nbsp;Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. The Extraterrestrial,&nbsp; Gremlins, Back to the Future, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Men In Black,&nbsp;and a ton of other successful movies, there is probably a pretty good chance that you own a private plane. Steven Spielberg owns a&nbsp;Bombardier Global Express jet. Of all the people on this list, he seems pretty likely to have one, after all some of these people are so rich that it simply makes sense to have a jet sitting around. What is he going to do, fly with JetBlue?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-travolta><strong>John Travolta</strong></h2><p>John Travolta has always been a bit flashy, even back when he was just starting out as a young actor, so it is no big surprise that he has a private jet. In fact, he has his pilots license and owns all sorts of planes, including a Boeing 707, Bombardier Challenger 601 jet, Boeing 727, and three Gulfstream jets. His net worth is around $170 million, which is a lot of money, but certainly not on the same level as Mark Zuckerberg and his $72 billion. He might have to make a few new movies and make some more cash before he has to sell off a couple of his planes. Just kidding&nbsp;— I am sure John Travolta is doing more than fine when it comes to his bank account.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bono><strong>Bono</strong></h2><p>Bono is one of the more interesting people on this list. Although he was the lead singer of his band&nbsp;U2&nbsp;—&nbsp;one of the most successful bands of all time&nbsp;— they started out as a working-class, political type of band, and look at them now.&nbsp; At one point, he&nbsp;leased an Airbus A310s for 18 months and customized it with a U2 logo. This is the thing about punk music, heavy metal, or even rock and roll, most people start off young and they are really angry all the time, but if they are successful, then they just wind up becoming rich and flying around in private planes. How are you supposed to stay angry when you are totally loaded?</p><h2 id=celine-dion><strong>Celine Dion</strong></h2><p>We all know Celine Dion is an incredibly successful singer and whether it be from selling records or tickets to her Vegas show, it's easy to imagine her with a private jet since she's worth $380 million.&nbsp;She&nbsp;owns a Bombardier Global Express jet. Considering she also has her own private island in Quebec&nbsp;— her homeland&nbsp;— she needs a private jet to get her from Vegas to Canada whenever she's in need of some downtime at home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=morgan-freeman><strong>Morgan Freeman</strong></h2><p>There is something about Morgan Freeman that is just so likeable. Not only is he just a fantastic actor, but he also seems like an incredibly nice guy. That is why it actually makes me happy to know that he not only owns one private jet, but that he has his pilots license and owns several.&nbsp;&nbsp;He owns a Cessna Citation 501, Cessna 414 twin-engine prop, and an Emivest SJ30. I wonder if it is too late to do a movie called&nbsp;Flying Miss Daisy as opposed to Driving Miss Daisy?</p><h2 id=ralph-lauren><strong>Ralph Lauren</strong></h2><p>Fashion designer Ralph Lauren&nbsp;owns a Hawker private plane and a Gulfstream G650. He is now worth almost $6 billion. It's quite impressive considering he came from nothing. This is the kind of thing that the American dream is all about, although it is hard to think of any American dream coming out quite that well. While it must be nice to have two private planes,&nbsp;many people on this list have even more than that. You would think one private jet is enough to get you from one place to another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jimmy-buffett><strong>Jimmy Buffett</strong></h2><p>There are certain celebrities out there that you would never have any idea that they are as rich as they actually are. One of those is Jimmy Buffet, who to most people is really well known for&nbsp;Margarataville&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cheeseburger in Paradise,&nbsp;and not a whole lot else. But the thing is, whether you know him or not, Buffet is the real deal. He is kind of like the Grateful Dead to a certain group of people. They call themselves "Parrotheads" and follow him around from show to show. You can't make up stuff like this. He has his license and owns a Hemisphere Dancer, a restored Grumman Albatross, and a Grumman Goose seaplane. Apparently, it pays pretty well to be worshipped by Parrotheads.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mark-cuban><strong>Mark Cuban</strong></h2><p>Possibly the least surprising person on this list is Mark Cuban. As the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, it might appear that he is more of a businessman than a celebrity, but don't forget about him on&nbsp;Shark Tank&nbsp;—&nbsp;he is obviously not just a rich billionaire, but he is also a TV star. He is another person on this list who has more than one plane. He has a Boeing 767 private jet and a Gulfstream 500. His net worth is just a little over $3 billion, so you know that he can afford as many private planes as he wants,&nbsp;along&nbsp;with anything else that his heart desires. Now all he has to do is get some better players on the Mavericks. Come on Mark, those guys stink!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZqOZqWLHbrTArGSaZWRleq61y6WgqKZdpb%2BqwsCtnGailal6coGMpqarnV2Ysq2xwaugraGVqHq4tM5mnaWxXZ67br%2FTsqOeZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjay-z-has-a-40-million-private-jet-15-more-celebrities-who-fly-in-style.html&text=Jay-Z%20Has%20A%20%2440%20Million%20Private%20Jet%3a%2015%20More%20Celebs%20Who%20Fly%20In%20Style&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjay-z-has-a-40-million-private-jet-15-more-celebrities-who-fly-in-style.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjay-z-has-a-40-million-private-jet-15-more-celebrities-who-fly-in-style.html&title=Jay-Z%20Has%20A%20%2440%20Million%20Private%20Jet%3a%2015%20More%20Celebs%20Who%20Fly%20In%20Style" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjay-z-has-a-40-million-private-jet-15-more-celebrities-who-fly-in-style.html&title=Jay-Z%20Has%20A%20%2440%20Million%20Private%20Jet%3a%2015%20More%20Celebs%20Who%20Fly%20In%20Style" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjay-z-has-a-40-million-private-jet-15-more-celebrities-who-fly-in-style.html&title=Jay-Z%20Has%20A%20%2440%20Million%20Private%20Jet%3a%2015%20More%20Celebs%20Who%20Fly%20In%20Style" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjay-z-has-a-40-million-private-jet-15-more-celebrities-who-fly-in-style.html&description=Jay-Z%20Has%20A%20%2440%20Million%20Private%20Jet%3a%2015%20More%20Celebs%20Who%20Fly%20In%20Style" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joey-barton-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joey Barton Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jasmine-yarbrough-wiki-bio-age-boyfriend-parents-family-net-worth-height-nationality-and-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jasmine Yarbrough Wiki, Bio, Age, Boyfriend, Parents, Family, Net Worth, Height, Nationality and Ins">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
