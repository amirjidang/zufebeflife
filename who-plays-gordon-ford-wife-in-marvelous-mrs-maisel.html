Nina is an award-winning American actress.</p><p>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is a popular American period comedy-drama television series, that premiered on March 17, 2017, on Prime Video. It is created by Amy Sherman-Palladino.</p><p>In developing the drama, Amy was inspired by childhood memories of her beloved father, a stand-up comic based in NYC, and admiration for early female comics such as Totie Fields and Joan Rivers.</p><p>Set in the late 1950s and early 1969s, the drama centers on Miriam “Midge” Maisel, a New York housewife who learns she has potential for stand-up comedy and pursues a career in it.</p><p>Rachel Brosnahan stars as the title character alongside Alex Borstein, Marin Hinkle, Kevin Pollak, Caroline Aaron, Like Kirby, and Michael Zegen.</p><p>Amazon renewed the series for a fifth and final season on February 17, 2022, which officially kicked off on April 14, 2023.</p><p>The series has received critical acclaim and multiple accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-gordon-ford-wife-in-mrs-maisel></span>Who Is Gordon Ford Wife In Mrs Maisel?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gordon Ford wife Hedy Ford in the Marvelous Mrs Maisel is Nina Arianda. She joined the cast of the comedy series in Season 5.</p><p>Hedy appears briefly in the first episode in the hallway scene. She also appears in the fourth and eighth episodes. Her husband, Gordon (Reid Scott), is a popular TV talk show host.</p><p>Speaking about the actress playing the role, Arianda is notable for portraying Vanda Jordan in Venus in Fur, for which she received a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play in 2012.</p><p>Moreover, she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play in 2011, following her remarkable performance as Billy Dawn in Born Yesterday, written by Garson Kanin.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>She made her break-out debut just months after graduating from NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts Graduate Acting Program in the 2010 off-Broadway production of Venus in Fur.</p><p>Arianda’s performance attracted the attention of the entire NY theatre community. In 2011, Venus in Fur transferred to Broadway, where her act became the most critically acclaimed of the 2011-12 season.</p><p>This recognition followed the actress’ 2011 nod for her Broadway debut in Born Yesterday. She also procured a role in Woody Allen’s Oscar-winning film Midnight in Paris.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>In 2014, Nina starred in the Manhattan Theatre Club’s production of Tales From Red Vienna.</p><p>She has appeared in several hit movies such as Tower Heist, Rob the Mob, Win Win, and The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby. In 2015, she landed the role of Molly Hannibal Season 3.</p><p>Her most recent work includes portraying Rebecca Cantu in Billions, Patty Solis-Papagian in Goliath, and Vovian Vance in Being the Ricardos.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-susie-and-hedy-ford-date></span>Did Susie And Hedy Ford Date?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Susie and Hedy were close in college over 15 years ago and possibly in a relationship. It’s implied that Susie was hurt by her actions in the past.</p><p>In the latest episode, Midge asks Susie if she knows anything about Ford’s wife, but she refuses to answer. By the end, it is revealed that the two might have been more than acquaintances.</p><p>At this point, very little information about Hedy has been revealed. From what the TV host told Midge, it’s clear their marriage is not the conventional one but more like an open marriage.</p><p>From his description, their marriage feels like a kind of arrangement, which might have something to do with his wife’s preference.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>Susie first learns about her while visiting 30 Rock. The two almost crossed paths in a previous episode. She peeks in at Ford’s office and finds a photo on his desk of a woman -clearly his wife.</p><p>When Susie comes to talk to Mike, she runs into Hedy again. This time, Hedy sees her and starts following her. Susie holds a grudge against her, while Hedy wants to make up for what she did.</p><p>Their conversation hints they met during their college years about 15 years ago. It seems they were together as Susie talks about all the plans and promises they made.</p><p>And while Susie was committed and took everything seriously, Hedy walked away. The former lashes out at the latter, saying that just because she got bored doesn’t mean it went away.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>The episode suggests Hedy was the one who walked away from their relationship, leaving Susie in a lurch.</p><p>Considering how viewers haven’t seen any love interest for Susie in the entire run of the series, we can assume that it might be because she had her heart broken in the past.</p><p>As a result, she decided not to waste time in relationships and dedicated herself to building a life and career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-season-5-episode-4-recap></span>The Marvelous Mrs Maisel Season 5 Episode 4 Recap<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The fourth episode of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Season 5 focuses on Susie Myerson’s personal and professional life.</p><p>Everyone except Midge is hungover after the party celebrating Ford’s show becoming No. 1. Ford talks to Midge about the drunken incident and apologizes for trying to kiss her.</p><p>Yet he asks her out on a date. She then states all the issues with this proposition mentioning Ford is married. He implies it is an open marriage so he can flirt and go on dates. But she declines.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>Meantime Nicky and Frank ask Susie for a favor reminding her how much she owes them. They want Midge to perform a scripted role in the expo. Myerson then convinces her to act in the show.</p><p>On the first night, Midge takes the role with diligence. The next day, a guest left at the last minute and she thought she had a chance to appear on The Gordin Ford Show.</p><p>She offers her expertise to the show, but Ford refuses and reminds her of their golden rule that doesn’t allow writers to appear on the show.</p><p>The stand-up comedian attends her second night expo angered by the rejection. She performs terribly ruining the whole show. Frand and Nikcy are furious with Susie and say she owes them.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>Joel overhears their argument and asks Myerson what his former wife is caught up in. However, she denies getting into the specifics.</p><p>At the last minute, Mike manages to book Sophie Lennon and she rocks on the show. Susie and Mike have a heated conversation backstage about the golden rule. Mike refuses to address the problem.</p><p>Susie leaves the studio and finds she is being followed by Ford’s wife, Hedy. It seems the two have a history together.</p><p>Hedy hurt her and broke many promises years ago. Myerson is still angered by her past experience and walks away from her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqxuMCyqmafn6exsLqMn6arnF2stqexjKKlZqWRp8OmuM6uqmaloqh6rq3IrJylZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-plays-gordon-ford-wife-in-marvelous-mrs-maisel.html&text=Who%20Plays%20Gordon%20Ford%20Wife%20In%20Marvelous%20Mrs%20Maisel%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-plays-gordon-ford-wife-in-marvelous-mrs-maisel.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-plays-gordon-ford-wife-in-marvelous-mrs-maisel.html&title=Who%20Plays%20Gordon%20Ford%20Wife%20In%20Marvelous%20Mrs%20Maisel%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-plays-gordon-ford-wife-in-marvelous-mrs-maisel.html&title=Who%20Plays%20Gordon%20Ford%20Wife%20In%20Marvelous%20Mrs%20Maisel%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-plays-gordon-ford-wife-in-marvelous-mrs-maisel.html&title=Who%20Plays%20Gordon%20Ford%20Wife%20In%20Marvelous%20Mrs%20Maisel%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-plays-gordon-ford-wife-in-marvelous-mrs-maisel.html&description=Who%20Plays%20Gordon%20Ford%20Wife%20In%20Marvelous%20Mrs%20Maisel%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-pictures-of-famous-politicians-throwing-up-middle-fingers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Pictures Of Famous Politicians Throwing Up Middle Fingers">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-lavontez-davis-suspect-arrested-for-murder-after-man-dies-following-attack-in-over-the-rhine-683553-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Lavontez Davis?
