The Swedish-born actress has appeared in a handful of successful films, including the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Netflix</strong></a> hit, 'The Sleepover', 'A Piece Of My Heart', and of course, the stars' most recent project, 'The Chick Fight', in which Akerman appears alongside big names such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bella Thorne</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alec Baldwin</a>, to name a few.

Akerman keeps her life quite private, including her marriage, which is exactly why not too many know much about either Malin or Jack! So, who exactly is Jack Donnelly? And have you seen him in anything before? Let's find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>New Netflix Series 'Bridgerton' With Julie Andrews Turns Heads With New Take On Victorian London</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-malin-akerman-s-hubby-jack-donnelly>Who Is Malin Akerman's Hubby, Jack Donnelly?</h2><p>Malin Akerman has on the rise within Hollywood! The actress is not only finding herself more and more in the spotlight, but she has been a part of countless successful films this year, including her hit 'The Sleepover', and 'Friendsgiving', which Malin appeared in alongside Kat Dennings, Aisha Tyler, Chelsea Perretti, and Wanda Sykes, to name a few. Although we know much about Malin and her journey to the big screen, it's her marriage to hubby, Jack Donnelly, that many fans do not know much about!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Akerman's nuptials to Donnelly marked the actress's second marriage, it was the first for Jack. Much like Malin, Jack Donnelly is also an actor and a rather successful one at that. Although he isn't on the same level as Brad Pitt and George Clooney, the star has appeared in a number of television series in both the United Kingdom and the United States, such as 'House of Anubis', 'Atlantis', and 'A Royal Winter'. Luckily for both Malin and Jack, it was their love for the arts that brought them together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Netflix Releases BTS Pictures From Set Of 'Elite' Season Four</a></span></p><p>According to Vogue, the two had initially <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">met through Malin Akerman's younger sister. </a>She had introduced Malin to Jack and the duo instantly hit it off. They remained as friends for nearly 2 years before becoming romantically involved, it's clear it was worth the wait! Malin revealed that the first time Jack made a move was back in New York City. The actor surprised Akerman at her apartment with a bouquet of flowers and headed over to Malin's favorite Brooklyn spot, making it obvious that Jack had done his homework!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Donelly now plays a major role in Malin's life as not only her husband but the step-father to her son from her first marriage with Robert Zincone. This not only proved Jack's love for Malin but his devotion to the two's marriage and family, as well. The trio has such a great dynamic that Malin's son, Sebastian, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even sang at her and Jack's wedding!&nbsp;</a></p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Thanksgiving Movie 'Friendsgiving' Is The Dysfunctional Celebration Of The Year</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuucCloKdlkaCys7nAp6pmoKWor6K6w2aYp5xdrLWiwIydpp6rXZ2ybrDOaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-malin-akermans-husband-and-what-does-he-do.html&text=Who%20Is%20Malin%20Akerman%27s%20Husband%2c%20And%20What%20Does%20He%20Do%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-malin-akermans-husband-and-what-does-he-do.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-malin-akermans-husband-and-what-does-he-do.html&title=Who%20Is%20Malin%20Akerman%27s%20Husband%2c%20And%20What%20Does%20He%20Do%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-malin-akermans-husband-and-what-does-he-do.html&title=Who%20Is%20Malin%20Akerman%27s%20Husband%2c%20And%20What%20Does%20He%20Do%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-malin-akermans-husband-and-what-does-he-do.html&title=Who%20Is%20Malin%20Akerman%27s%20Husband%2c%20And%20What%20Does%20He%20Do%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-malin-akermans-husband-and-what-does-he-do.html&description=Who%20Is%20Malin%20Akerman%27s%20Husband%2c%20And%20What%20Does%20He%20Do%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./wonder-woman-1984-release-date.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wonder Woman 1984 To Debut On HBO Max Alongside Theatrical Release">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-gio-helou-from-selling-the-oc-meet-the-realtor-associates-wife-tiffany-helou-320173-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Gio Helou From Selling The OC?
