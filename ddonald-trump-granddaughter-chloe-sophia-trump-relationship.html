He has been married three times and has five kids and 10 grandkids. But although he has a large family, he isn't close to everyone. For instance, <a href=#>Trump and his wealthy daughter Tiffany</a> don't get along very well.</p><p>While some of Donald Trump's grandchildren are talked about as often as the rest of the family is, Chloe Sophia Grace isn't mentioned all that often. Here's whether Donald Trump has a close connection to his granddaughter Chloe Sophia Trump.</p><h2 id=who-is-donald-trump-39-s-granddaughter-chloe-sophia-trump>Who Is Donald Trump's Granddaughter Chloe Sophia Trump?</h2><p>Chloe Sophia Trump is the daughter of Vanessa Trump and Donald Trump Jr. According to People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chloe Sophia Trump was born</a> on June 16th, 2014. She turned nine years old in June 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Donald Trump Jr. and Vanessa have four other children: 20-month-old Spencer Frederick, 2-and-a-half-year-old Tristan Milos, five-year-old Donald John III, and seven-year-old Kai Madison.</p><p>When the couple was expecting their fifth child, Donald Trump Jr. explained in an interview with Us Weekly, "We are thrilled to be welcoming baby number 5 this summer! Vanessa and I can't wait to continue the adventure of raising the big family we have always wanted and have been blessed to receive."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/donald-trump-jr-daughter-kai.jpg><p>However, the couple got divorced in 2018. Now, Donald Trump Jr. is engaged to Kimberly Guilfoyle, and <a href=#>the couple posts about their family on Instagram</a> quite often.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chloe Sophia Trump is only in the news from time to time. For example, when the New York Primary took place in April 2016, UPI reported that Vanessa brought Chloe along when she voted at a secondary school.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Donald Trump Jr. Visited The Playboy Mansion And His Experience Was Nothing Like His Father's</a></span></p><p>Chloe Sophia Trump and Donald Trump Jr. spend a lot of time together.

He said, "She wanted go on the boat with Dada and I am not good at saying no to her, It was the first time I've been in a boat without a fishing rod in a long time and I may like this better."</p><p>In 2018, Us Weekly reported that Donald Trump Jr. posted about Chloe on social media after it became public knowledge that he and Vanessa were splitting up. He wrote, “No matter what is going on bedtime cuddling with the smurf puts a Yuge smile on my face."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/donald-trump-jr-was-briefly-locked-up-in-jail-and-most-fans-and-critics-of-the-family-don-t-even-know-about-it.jpg><p>That same year, Vanity Fair reported that Donald Trump Jr. shared a video on his Instagram account of him inquiring about which political candidate Chloe would vote for. She said "Elmo" and when he asked "What about Grandpa?" she agreed that she would vote for Elmo and then her grandfather.</p><h2 id=how-close-are-chloe-sophia-trump-and-donald-trump>How Close Are Chloe Sophia Trump And Donald Trump?</h2><p>It's unclear how close Donald Trump is to his granddaughter Chloe Sophia Trump. Donald Trump Jr. has shared some photos of Chloe and her grandfather, which suggests that they do have a relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/donald-trump-chloe-sophia-trump-donald-trump-jr.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Donald Trump doesn't seem to have ever spoken about his granddaughter Chloe Sophia Trump. He did say once that he doesn't like the term "grandpa." In 2011, Melania and Donald Trump were interviewed by Oprah. Donald said of "grandpa," "It's an unusual word. I was never in love with that word."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Russell Brand Was Left Confused Over The Request Donald Trump Made When They Privately Met At Trump Tower</a></span></p><p>In general, though, the Trump family says that Donald and his grandkids get along great.</p><p>In 2016, his daughter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ivanka Trump talked about Donald as a grandfather</a> in an interview with Yahoo Parenting. She said, "Incredible. He’s really, really amazing with the kids. They see him most weekends during the summer. We’re together in New Jersey with one of our golf clubs. They spend a lot of time rolling around with him on golf carts.

I just thought that was such a cute comment. [Because of him,] she’s paying attention to New York City infrastructure!"</p><p>In her interview, Ivanka was asked about what she did when she was a child. She explained, "Lots centered around the holidays: Thanksgiving together, cutting down trees at Christmas. We just had a lot of things that we’d do as a group, different games we’d play inside and outside."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jerry Seinfeld Had A Specific Reason For Not Wanting Donald Trump On His Show</a></span></p><p>Trump's grandchildren were often present when he made public appearances when he was in office. In September 2020, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner attended one of Trump's rallies along with their children Joseph and Arabella, according to The Daily Mail. There are many similar news articles that suggest that at various points, all of Trump's grandchildren attended these types of public events.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/has-ivanka-trump-s-relationship-with-brother-donald-trump-jr-changed-since-she-stepped-away-from-the-limelight_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Trump family does seem to get together a lot, and they are there for each other's big life milestones. When Tiffany Trump and Michael Boulos got married in 2022, Ivanka was the Maid of Honor, and the other Trump children were there as well, according to Page Six. Donald Trump Jr. posted on Instagram that his five kids were wedding guests as well.</p><p>Since Donald Trump Jr. has always appeared to be close to his father Donald Trump, it's possible to assume that Donald and Chloe Sophia Grace have always seen each other regularly. A few years ago, The Daily Mail reported that Donald Trump Jr. and his kids visited Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Easter weekend. Donald's other children were there as well.</p><p>Donald Trump Jr. shared about the trip and wrote, "A little breakfast and grandpa duty on the calendar for the weekend." He posted some pictures of the family on his Instagram account. Chloe was in a few of the pictures and had a big smile on her face in each one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibnaeelrmledOrrKaoXZy%2ForrDnZiun5ipsrN5wqGjqJ1dqLyxtMiaZK2qpaK9br7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fddonald-trump-granddaughter-chloe-sophia-trump-relationship.html&text=Does%20Chloe%20Sophia%20Trump%20Have%20A%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Grandfather%20Donald%20Trump%3f%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fddonald-trump-granddaughter-chloe-sophia-trump-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fddonald-trump-granddaughter-chloe-sophia-trump-relationship.html&title=Does%20Chloe%20Sophia%20Trump%20Have%20A%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Grandfather%20Donald%20Trump%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fddonald-trump-granddaughter-chloe-sophia-trump-relationship.html&title=Does%20Chloe%20Sophia%20Trump%20Have%20A%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Grandfather%20Donald%20Trump%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fddonald-trump-granddaughter-chloe-sophia-trump-relationship.html&title=Does%20Chloe%20Sophia%20Trump%20Have%20A%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Grandfather%20Donald%20Trump%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fddonald-trump-granddaughter-chloe-sophia-trump-relationship.html&description=Does%20Chloe%20Sophia%20Trump%20Have%20A%20Relationship%20With%20Her%20Grandfather%20Donald%20Trump%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./emily-deschanel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emily Deschanel News - Us Weekly">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chin-up-high-tiktok-song-and-lyrics-reaction-who-is-ame-bibabi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chin Up High TikTok Song and Lyrics Reaction  Who is Ame Bibabi?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
