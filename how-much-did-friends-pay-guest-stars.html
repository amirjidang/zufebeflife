Though Brad, at the time, was already a big name in Hollywood, not every guest star was someone uber-famous.</p><p>Case in point? Vincent Ventresca.

He said of receiving word that Friends was auditioning for small parts, "I thought I was the coolest person in the world... But something inside me told me, just do it."</p><p>During his first appearance as Fun Bobby, Vincent said the "energy was good."

Even though Jean-Claude was a noteworthy guest star, <a href=#>he was not fun to deal with on set</a>, so probably wasn't given a long-term deal.</p><p>As for Fun Bobby, AKA Vincent Ventresca, he was invited back for a second episode after playing Rachel Green's boyfriend one time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 'Friends' Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vincent told The Guardian that the main cast "must be really rich," because in 2019, he was still receiving royalty checks from Friends. According to Ventresca, his royalties amount to about $2,000 per year, an apparent average over the years since his appearance on episodes "The One with the Monkey" (1994) and "The One with Russ" (1996).</p><p>For anyone lucky enough to have gotten a gig on Friends in its heyday, those royalty checks might be small, but they likely won't stop coming.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1llqe2prrDrGSpmalitLax0q1krKyRp8Bw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-did-friends-pay-guest-stars.html&text=Monica%27s%20Boyfriend%20%26quot%3bFun%20Bobby%26quot%3b%20Didn%27t%20Know%20How%20Rich%20The%20%27Friends%27%20Cast%20Was%20Until%20He%20Started%20Receivin&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-did-friends-pay-guest-stars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-did-friends-pay-guest-stars.html&title=Monica%27s%20Boyfriend%20%26quot%3bFun%20Bobby%26quot%3b%20Didn%27t%20Know%20How%20Rich%20The%20%27Friends%27%20Cast%20Was%20Until%20He%20Started%20Receivin" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-did-friends-pay-guest-stars.html&title=Monica%27s%20Boyfriend%20%26quot%3bFun%20Bobby%26quot%3b%20Didn%27t%20Know%20How%20Rich%20The%20%27Friends%27%20Cast%20Was%20Until%20He%20Started%20Receivin" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-did-friends-pay-guest-stars.html&title=Monica%27s%20Boyfriend%20%26quot%3bFun%20Bobby%26quot%3b%20Didn%27t%20Know%20How%20Rich%20The%20%27Friends%27%20Cast%20Was%20Until%20He%20Started%20Receivin" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-did-friends-pay-guest-stars.html&description=Monica%27s%20Boyfriend%20%26quot%3bFun%20Bobby%26quot%3b%20Didn%27t%20Know%20How%20Rich%20The%20%27Friends%27%20Cast%20Was%20Until%20He%20Started%20Receivin" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1135407-njpw-destruction-in-kagoshima-results-9-16-live-in-progress.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NJPW Destruction In Kagoshima Results (9/16) G1 Climax Rematch, Birds of Prey, More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./michael-cammalleri-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Cammalleri Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
