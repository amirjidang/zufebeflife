Britney resents that her dad is given a monthly allowance which is around $10,000 a month for his services overseeing her finances.”</p><p>It should also be noted that Britney, who hasn’t released an album since 2016’s Glory, continues to pay hundreds of thousands in fees to the people who work with Jamie in overseeing the conservatorship, on top of the money that her father gets for his supervision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In December 2020, Jamie came forwarded to speak his mind following months of online abuse from Britney’s fans who insisted that the “Toxic” star was being unfairly treated by her dad.</p><p>Jamie had claimed in court papers that his daughter was mentally incapable of taking care of herself yet he had no issue with her embarking on grueling world tours and fronting Las Vegas residencies for a two-year period.</p><p>The latter&nbsp;was firm with his words to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, asserting that Brit needs all the support she can get, and while the two have had their ups and downs in the past year, he stressed that he wouldn’t stop helping his daughter with her mental health condition for as long as the court continues to believe his contributions to the conservatorship remain valid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How I Met Your Mother: Best Season 3 Episodes, According To IMDb</a></span></p><p>“I love my daughter and I miss her very much. When a family member needs special care and protection, families need to step up, as I have done for the last 12-plus years, to safeguard, protect and continue to love Britney unconditionally.</p><p>“I have and will continue to provide unwavering love and fierce protection against those with self-serving interests and those who seek to harm her or my family.”</p><p>Jamie’s attorney Vivian Lee Thoreen echoed similar words by claiming that the relationship his client shares with Britney is no different than the one that others share with their father, adding that despite all that’s been said in the press, the two were still on speaking terms with one another.</p><p>“Jamie’s relationship with Britney is not that different than your average father-daughter relationship insofar as there has always been a mutual love and respect for each other,” she explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Until Britney’s court-appointed attorney Sam Ingham abruptly instructed Jamie not to contact Britney a few months ago, Jamie and Britney had spoken often and regularly throughout the entire conservatorship. In fact, they had spoken just the day before and had had a pleasant and collaborative conversation.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Takeaways From Katy Perry’s Documentary Movie ‘Part Of Me’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7KiuIyrnJqrn6N6o77IraWesV2ovaat0axkp52kYsSwvtOhZKGZo2K9rcHMppytnZRiwbB5ya6qrWVmZXqutculoKimXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-real-reason-britney-spears-net-worth-has-plummeted-to-just-60-million.html&text=The%20Real%20Reason%20Britney%20Spears%20Net%20Worth%20Has%20Plummeted%20To%20Just%20%2460%20Million&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-real-reason-britney-spears-net-worth-has-plummeted-to-just-60-million.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-real-reason-britney-spears-net-worth-has-plummeted-to-just-60-million.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Britney%20Spears%20Net%20Worth%20Has%20Plummeted%20To%20Just%20%2460%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-real-reason-britney-spears-net-worth-has-plummeted-to-just-60-million.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Britney%20Spears%20Net%20Worth%20Has%20Plummeted%20To%20Just%20%2460%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-real-reason-britney-spears-net-worth-has-plummeted-to-just-60-million.html&title=The%20Real%20Reason%20Britney%20Spears%20Net%20Worth%20Has%20Plummeted%20To%20Just%20%2460%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-real-reason-britney-spears-net-worth-has-plummeted-to-just-60-million.html&description=The%20Real%20Reason%20Britney%20Spears%20Net%20Worth%20Has%20Plummeted%20To%20Just%20%2460%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./billy-joel-howard-stern-interview-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth About Billy Joel And Howard Stern's Relationship Before Their Bombshell Interviews">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./robert-pattinson-suki-waterhouses-relationship-timeline-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robert Pattinson, Suki Waterhouses Relationship Timeline: Photos">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
