A lot of the times, a celebrity's tattoos&nbsp;can give fans a window into who they really are because they usually have a pretty interesting back story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the heavily tattooed celebrities out there, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande, who has a grand total of 51 tattoos</a>, and Eminem, who has nine, use their tattoos to tell fans a little more about them, and some times even hint about something. Some celebrities like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas even get couples tattoos</a>.</p><p>But let us not forget some of the failed celebrity tattoos, like the time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Depp got the tattoo, "Winona Forever"</a>. He&nbsp;changed to "Wino Forever," after they split.</p><p>Another celebrity that you might not have known to have had a failed tattoo (although it's weird he even had one, to begin with) is Leonardo DiCaprio.</p><p>That tattoo was such a fail, in fact, that DiCaprio wanted it gone altogether.</p><h2 id=the-story-of-the-tattoo-dates-back-to-dicaprio-s-time-with-his-infamous-friend-group-the-pussy-posse>The Story Of The Tattoo Dates Back To DiCaprio's Time With His Infamous Friend Group, The Pussy Posse</h2><p>The origins of the "Pussy Posse", as they were called, came around the time DiCaprio made friends with a group of other child actors. First, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he befriended Tobey Maguire</a>, and then&nbsp;Lukas Haas&nbsp;and Kevin Connolly, and all of the others that came and went over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The interesting thing about their friendship dynamic was that all of them knew DiCaprio was the rising star, even though they weren't having any successes. He beat them out in auditions and they watched him take on the best roles time and time again.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What These Celebs Have Said About Leonardo DiCaprio (Good And Bad)&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>But they didn't let that affect their group, ever, because they were all still living in a sort of fraternity house for young actors together, roaming L.A. in their pack causing mayhem.</p><p>When DiCaprio got the part of Romeo in Romeo + Juliet&nbsp;he was invited out to Australia to film it. He wound up trading his first-class ticket for five tickets for his group of friends to come along. From then on they became known as the Pussy Posse.</p><p>They were each other's wingmen as they traveled around the world, partying and getting with as many girls as possible. But they had each other's backs outside the clubs as well and protected one another if fights broke out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They even made a small indie film called Don's Plum, which portrayed an exaggerated version of their friend dynamic. The film saw the group hanging out in a restaurant, Don's Plum, talking about vulgar things, and shouting at girls. The film was never released.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo DiCaprio And Tobey Maguire: Little Known Facts About Their Friendship</a></span></p><p>Amongst all the goofing around they did, they also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sealed their group with matching tattoos</a>, which really did symbolize that they were a pack for life. At some point in the height of the Pussy Posse they all got a "quarter-sized tattoo featuring a wolf-like creature brandishing different-sized fangs, dripping with two drops of blood."</p><p>DiCaprio's was reported on his right ankle. Here's what the tattoo reportedly looked like:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dicaprio-reportedly-had-it-removed>&nbsp;DiCaprio Reportedly Had It Removed</h2><p>Some people online have said that the tattoo is more like a cloth with blood on it, rather than a wolf. Others have said that the tattoo has only been recently spotted for the first time, so it is unknown when he actually got it removed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The sketches of the tattoo are apparently being kept under wraps</a> at the tattoo salon where DiCaprio got his done, the famous&nbsp;Shamrock Social Club. The salon also has a record of all the members of the Pussy Posse that have the tattoo as well.</p><p>Fans, at one point, thought that DiCaprio got the tattoo his character Richard has in The Beach, which is a simple claw mark design. But the design on his shoulder was fake and only for the movie.</p><h2 id=dicaprio-almost-had-another-tattoo-from-a-bet-with-tom-hardy>DiCaprio Almost Had Another Tattoo From A Bet With Tom Hardy</h2><p>DiCaprio's Revenant co-star, Tom Hardy, would probably agree that tattoos are meaningful because all of&nbsp;the&nbsp;tattoos that&nbsp;cover his body are just as meaningful as DiCaprio's wolf tattoo. One of Hardy's tattoos has a connection with DiCaprio in fact, and it wasn't really expected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it was first reported that Hardy was getting a new tattoo, he revealed that he hadn't gotten it yet "because it sucks." What Hardy meant by that was the tattoo was a result of a lost bet between him and DiCaprio on the set of The Revenant, according to Esquire.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos Of Models Leonardo DiCaprio Has Dated&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>The bet started when DiCaprio predicted that Hardy would get an Oscar nomination for his supporting role in the film. In return, Hardy suggested a tattoo of the winner's choosing if he didn't get a nomination. Of course, Hardy lost the bet when he was nominated.</p><p>The tattoo turned out to be 'Leo knows everything.' Apparently DiCaprio was pretty sure that Hardy would get the nomination because he probably wouldn't have agreed if a tattoo was involved, he clearly dislikes them that much.</p><p>Hardy agrees and thinks that DiCaprio would have never held up his end of the bet. "He would never get a tattoo if he lost that bet! It was just one-way," Hardy said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hardy has so many tattoos anyway, it wasn't such a big deal for him. He even has a couple with people's names, including his past wife and even his agent. So, DiCaprio's name wouldn't look so out of place.</p><p>So it's safe to say that we shouldn't expect any more tattoos for DiCaprio any time soon. But if he didn't like them to begin with, why did he go through with it? Maybe the bond of the Pussy Posse is just too great to refuse a membership tattoo.</p><p>DiCaprio might not have it anymore but the gang still lives on.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Could Leonardo DiCaprio Be Ready To Pop The Question?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmo56nnpa%2FpbuMnaCcmaCntrB5x5qbZqCZqHq0scKrnK1lpJbBtbvOZqmepZ%2BrsqV7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheres-why-leonardo-dicaprio-had-his-secret-tattoo-removed.html&text=Here%27s%20Why%20Leonardo%20DiCaprio%20Had%20His%20Secret%20Tattoo%20Removed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-why-leonardo-dicaprio-had-his-secret-tattoo-removed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-leonardo-dicaprio-had-his-secret-tattoo-removed.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Leonardo%20DiCaprio%20Had%20His%20Secret%20Tattoo%20Removed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheres-why-leonardo-dicaprio-had-his-secret-tattoo-removed.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Leonardo%20DiCaprio%20Had%20His%20Secret%20Tattoo%20Removed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-leonardo-dicaprio-had-his-secret-tattoo-removed.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Leonardo%20DiCaprio%20Had%20His%20Secret%20Tattoo%20Removed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-why-leonardo-dicaprio-had-his-secret-tattoo-removed.html&description=Here%27s%20Why%20Leonardo%20DiCaprio%20Had%20His%20Secret%20Tattoo%20Removed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hilarie-burton-morgan-says-she-and-chad-michael-murray-werent-asked-back-for-oth-season-7.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hilarie Burton Morgan Wasn't Asked Back for One Tree Hill Season 7">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./blog.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heidi V.
