Or when they've hit the limit of their patience, even the following famous politicians will brazenly put up a middle finger and flip off their interlocutors. On camera. Other times they'll try to sneak one in and play it off as an articulating gesture or a scratch of the cheek. But you might be surprised which one flipped off the camera just for a laugh.</p><h2 id=president-obama-flips-john-mccain-the-bird>15. President Obama Flips John McCain The Bird</h2><p>via:&nbsp;YouTube.com</p><p>Back in 2008 on the campaign trail, shortly before winning an election with historical turnout, especially among minorities and women, <a href=#>President Obama</a> had a backhanded compliment to give&nbsp;Republican presidential candidate <a href=#>John McCain</a>, accompanied with a sly flip of his middle finger.</p><p>Obama said the following in a televised speech: "Now Senator McCain has served this country honorably. And at the end of this long race I wanna congratulate him on the tough race that he has fought," and after he completed this sentence, it appears that the President gave McCain the finger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=senator-rand-paul-r-ky-flips-off-fox-business>14. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) Flips Off Fox Business</h2><p>via: Dailycaller.com</p><p>After low polling numbers excluded the illustrious Kentucky Senator Rand Paul from a Republican presidential primary debate hosted by Fox Business, the very articulate young senator was fuming. When asked in an ABC News Radio interview if he had a message to the press, Paul put up a middle finger.</p><h2 id=george-w-bush-flips-off-camera-and-laughs>13. George W. Bush Flips Off Camera And Laughs</h2><p>via:&nbsp;YouTube.com</p><p>In a hilarious video dating back before <a href=#>George W. Bush</a>'s presidency, most likely to his days running for governor in Texas, Bush is preparing for a television interview. Ever the Yale frat boy, he fixes his hair and then suddenly flips off the camera to whoops and laughter from the people in the studio. Bush sports a huge grin and snickers. One woman can be heard exclaiming, "Were we rolling tape on that? Oh my..." Bush responds in his trademark&nbsp;Texas accent, "It's a one-fingered victory salute!"</p><h2 id=vice-president-joe-biden-flips-off-paul-ryan-during-vp-debate>12.

During the 2012 Vice Presidential debate, Joe Biden, well-known for being a loose cannon, appears to give Paul Ryan the middle finger while criticizing the Republican ticket.</p><h2 id=former-mexican-president-vincente-fox-gives-trump-the-finger>11. Former Mexican President Vincente Fox Gives Trump The Finger</h2><p>via: breitbart.com</p><p>During a now famous interview, former Mexican President Vincente Fox did not mince words with respect to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Though the interview was in Spanish, when he got to his message for Donald Trump, Fox switched to English, saying, "I am not going to pay for this f*cking wall." He followed up on that the next day with a photo of him smiling into the camera and flipping Trump the bird.</p><h2 id=senate-majority-leader-harry-reid-d-nv-flips-the-bird>10.

An image of him sticking up his middle finger started making its rounds about that time.</p><h2 id=republican-senator-jim-bunning-ky-flips-off-reporter>9. Republican Senator Jim Bunning (KY) Flips Off Reporter</h2><p>via: foxnews.com</p><p>Rand Paul isn't the only Kentucky senator who can throw fingers. In a tragic accident of history that can never be rectified, no one actually caught this one on camera, but it was widely reported when long-serving Senator Jim Bunning, widely known at the time as the most conservative man in the Senate, got irritated with an ABC News reporter after rebuffing his attempts to get an interview. Bunning stormed away with his hand in the air above his head, flying a middle finger to show his disdain.</p><h2 id=vice-president-nelson-rockefeller-flips-off-young-hecklers>8. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller Flips Off Young Hecklers</h2><p>via: rarehistoricalphotos.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is one of the oldest photos of a US politician flipping&nbsp;the bird, and this one is a true classic! Vice President Nelson Rockefeller was giving a speech at Binghamton University in New York when some young hecklers in the crowd found the limits of his patience. Not too square to sling a middle finger, the Vice President cheerfully flips the students off and he really sticks the landing. Just look at that form! (That's Bob Dole photobombing in the background.)</p><h2 id=german-vice-chancellor-sigmar-gabriel-gives-nazis-the-bird>7. German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel Gives Nazis The Bird</h2><p>via: spiegel.de</p><p>German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel had heard enough from a group of Nazi protestors. In a video that circulated earlier this year, the Nazis can be heard calling Gabriel a "race-traitor," accusing him of being a communist, and referencing his father, who was a Nazi sympathizer: "Your father loved his country, and what do you do? You destroy it." The liberal Vice Chancellor can be seen laughing it off before putting his middle digit up high for the Nazis to see.</p><h2 id=federal-reserve-chairman-ben-bernanke-had-enough>6.

And Bernanke may not have intended to flip us off with this gesture,&nbsp;but hell if it isn't the most perfect image to capture the attitude many think Bernanke has for America's struggling workers as his Federal Reserve more than doubled the adjusted monetary base, obliterating the purchasing power of every one of those hard-earned dollars.</p><h2 id=disgraced-congressman-anthony-weiner-d-ny-gives-nyc-the-finger>5. Disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY) Gives NYC The Finger</h2><p>via: Foxnews.com</p><p>Former Congressman <a href=#>Anthony Weiner</a> - well-known for having a potty mouth - had planned a big comeback bid after resigning from Congress in the grip of a dick pic tweeting scandal. But while running for mayor of New York, and even starting to gain traction, a second Twitter&nbsp;scandal knocked the wind out of his sails and sent his campaign into free fall. After losing the mayoral primary, the former congressman gave his concession speech and flashed reporters his middle finger as he rolled away in his car. They were probably lucky that's all he flashed them!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=senator-barbara-boxer-d-ca-flips-off-bernie-sanders-supporters-in-nevada>4. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) Flips Off Bernie Sanders Supporters in Nevada</h2><p>via: reddit.com</p><p>The 2016 Democratic State Convention in Nevada was very heated. Disenfranchised Bernie Sanders supporters became unruly and booed Senator Boxer off the stage. As she exited, the senior Senator from California turned around and gave Bernie's supporters the middle finger.</p><h2 id=president-of-the-philippines-rodrigo-duterte-flips-off-european-union>3. President Of The Philippines Rodrigo Duterte Flips Off European Union</h2><p>via: abcnews.com</p><p>Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has made quite the reputation for himself as a volatile and dangerous president. Since taking office, he has started a campaign against drug users involving extra-judicial killings, and has even said that he wants to be to drug users in the Philippines what Hitler was to the Jews. Well, the international community isn't so cool with presidents rounding up citizens and shooting them with no charges and no fair trial. When the European Union came out and criticized Duterte for his campaign of terror against drug users, his answer for them was his middle finger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=president-george-bush-senior-accidentally-gives-aussies-the-forks>2. President George Bush Senior Accidentally Gives Aussies "The Forks"</h2><p>via: Slate.com</p><p>To be fair to the President, he didn't know what he was doing was wrong. When George Bush Sr. visited Australia in 1992, he flashed a crowd of Aussies the "V for victory" sign as he rode past in his armored car. What he didn't know, was that this WWII sign for victory means something entirely different in the land down under. It's called giving "the forks" and it's the Aussie equivalent of putting up your middle finger. So George Bush unwittingly flipped all these Australians off.</p><h2 id=donald-trump-is-a-walking-breathing-middle-finger-in-the-air>1. Donald Trump Is A Walking, Breathing Middle Finger In The Air</h2><p>via: memegenerator</p><p>While he hasn't been caught on camera giving the middle finger, which is pretty surprising when you consider what he has been caught on camera doing and saying, <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> himself is the middle finger of an insurgent movement within the Republican Party. A lot of them are even referring to their vote as a "middle finger" vote against the establishment. How that will turn out for them and the rest of America, time will surely tell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKCfmLiqusZoaG5loJ6wtcHRnqpmp5Zis6K5zq6qZqifoba1tcKimKerXam1s7vWoqWgZaWleq61w52jnmWWnruosdGsZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-pictures-of-famous-politicians-throwing-up-middle-fingers.html&text=15%20Pictures%20Of%20Famous%20Politicians%20Throwing%20Up%20Middle%20Fingers&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-pictures-of-famous-politicians-throwing-up-middle-fingers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-pictures-of-famous-politicians-throwing-up-middle-fingers.html&title=15%20Pictures%20Of%20Famous%20Politicians%20Throwing%20Up%20Middle%20Fingers" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-pictures-of-famous-politicians-throwing-up-middle-fingers.html&title=15%20Pictures%20Of%20Famous%20Politicians%20Throwing%20Up%20Middle%20Fingers" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-pictures-of-famous-politicians-throwing-up-middle-fingers.html&title=15%20Pictures%20Of%20Famous%20Politicians%20Throwing%20Up%20Middle%20Fingers" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-pictures-of-famous-politicians-throwing-up-middle-fingers.html&description=15%20Pictures%20Of%20Famous%20Politicians%20Throwing%20Up%20Middle%20Fingers" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./20-pics-of-a-list-celebs-making-fun-of-the-paparazzi-after-being-caught-in-public.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Pics Of A-List Celebs Trolling The Paparazzi After Being Caught In Public">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-plays-gordon-ford-wife-in-marvelous-mrs-maisel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Plays Gordon Ford Wife In Marvelous Mrs Maisel?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
