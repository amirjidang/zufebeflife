Since Home Improvement is now a <a href=#>Disney+ show with an A-list star</a>, many people have been rewatching the show for the first time in years.</p><p>When people rediscover Home Improvement, they typically are reminded of how funny Jonathan Taylor Thomas could be. They also likely remember that while JTT never <a href=#>earned $1 million per episode like some TV stars</a>, many fans were obsessed with him. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, did JTT's co-stars treat him differently once he became a teen heartthrob?</p><h2 id=jonathan-taylor-thomas-became-a-teenage-heartthrob-on-home-improvement>Jonathan Taylor Thomas Became A Teenage Heartthrob On Home Improvement</h2><p>When Home Improvement's first season started filming, there was no way for anyone to know how the show would be received. More than that, there certainly was no to know that one of the show's child stars would become a sensation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Home-Improvement-Cast.jpg><p>For anyone who doesn't remember how crazy Jonathan Taylor Thomas mania was, it is hard to describe how many fans were smitten with him. What can be revealed, however, is Thomas received so much attention that even the mainstream media covered the situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jonathan-taylor-thomas-and-scarlett-pomers-aren-t-the-only-child-stars-to-keep-their-lives-a-secret-after-vanishing-from-hollywood.jpg><p>In 1997, a writer for the Washington Post penned an article about Thomas. During that piece, the writer wrote about a slew of fans waiting hours to meet Thomas and get his signature. More notably, the writer described <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the scene once Thomas arrived</a> and his adoring public caught a glimpse of the actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Finally, a limo approaches. Squeals erupt from the theater lobby, where a poster advertises a chance to "Win a Date" with JTT or one of his Wild America co-stars. Cameras snap. 'Jonathan, Jonathan . . . this way, Jonathan,' the exiled press corps demands."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Did Home Improvement's Patricia Richardson Refuse A Fortune To Star In Another Season?</a></span></p><p>Even years after Jonathan Taylor Thomas mania faded away, there were still plenty of people who didn't forget. In 2015, one of the people who recalled how out of control the attention paid to Thomas was put together an MTV.com article.</p><p>In Amanda Bell's 2015 MTV.com article, she put together "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Definitive Ranking Of JTT's Teen Mag Covers</a>". Unfortunately, the article's images are now broken, so it doesn't reveal much other than the fact that Thomas appeared on an incredible amount of magazine covers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-was-jonathan-taylor-thomas-39-relationship-with-the-home-improvement-cast>What Was Jonathan Taylor Thomas' Relationship With The Home Improvement Cast?</h2><p>In the entertainment industry, there are certain attributes that people often need to survive. As a result, it arguably is a good thing when an entertainer has personality traits like competitiveness, and they have very high expectations for themself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/did-jonathan-taylor-thomas-home-improvement-co-stars-treat-him-differently-after-he-became-a-teen-heartthrob_.jpg><p>However, when multiple people who work together all the time have those personality traits, that can easily become a problem. Worse yet, when one of those people suddenly starts to get infinitely more attention than the rest, things can really go awry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Jonathan Taylor Thomas became a teen heartthrob, the amount of attention he received exploded. Once Thomas was thrust into the spotlight pretty much overnight, all of his Home Improvement co-stars had to take notice. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question. Did Thomas' Home Improvement co-stars treat him differently once he became a heartthrob?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dave Chappelle's Random Home Improvement Cameo Would Lead To ABC Launching A Disastrous Spin-Off For The Comedian</a></span></p><p>Fortunately for curious fans, it is possible to have some idea of how Thomas was treated once he became a teen heartthrob. The reason that is the case is Thomas once was asked how his co-stars reacted to his superstar status.</p><p>In 2011, there was a Home Improvement reunion photo shoot that brought together the show's former main stars aside from Earl Hindman. After that, Thomas was interviewed by Entertainment Weekly about that experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/zachary-ty-bryan-and-jonathan-taylor-thomas-from-a-home-improvement-photoshoot.jpg><p>Unsurprisingly, Entertainment Weekly's interviewer briefly brought up Thomas' former status as a teen heartthrob. "You single-handedly gave the teen fan magazines a reason to stay in business back in the 90s. Were you on the cover every week?"</p><p>In response to that question, Thomas gave a seemingly humble response when he simply said, "I guess so, yeah." Entertainment Weekly's interviewer followed up by asking Thomas about how his former co-stars reacted when he became a Tiger Beat mainstay. "Did the cast tease you about your idol status?"</p><p>In response to that question, Thomas unsurprisingly stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his former co-stars made fun of his legion of devoted teen fans</a>. That said, Thomas made sure to state that the mockery he received from his co-stars was in good fun. On top of that, Thomas clarified that he wasn't made fun of too much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Zachery Ty Bryan Still Earn Massive Home Improvement Royalties Despite His Jail Time And Felony Charges?</a></span></p><p>"Oh yeah, every once in a while, it was always in good humor. It was too tempting not to be brought up on occasion. There are too many things you could make fun of."</p><p>On top of Thomas' remarks, there is more proof that the actor's co-stars treated him differently. In 2021, the former Home Improvement star Zachary Ty Bryan very publicly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made a joke about how many people were smitten with Thomas</a> when they were kids.</p><p>On Instagram, Bryan shared a childhood photo of himself alongside Thomas. Alongside the image, Bryan included the caption, “The 2nd best looking guy in a photo of 2". The caption seemed to be an obvious reference to how smitten everyone was with Thomas when the photo was taken.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jonathan-taylor-thomas-when-he-was-a-teen-heartthrob.jpg><p>Based on what is known about Thomas' heartthrob years, it seems like he was teased and supported by his co-stars. The reason for that might be that according to what Patricia Richardson wrote during a Reddit Ask Me Anything session, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas handled the attention well</a>.</p><p>"I think that it was very fortunate that Jonathan is so smart and well-balanced. Jonathan knew that pitfalls of the situation that he was in. When he left the show he ended up going back to school and got a really good education and thought a lot about what he wanted to do with his life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Richardson later continued, "I can't speak for Jonathan if he was uncomfortable with fame like I was but we both coincidentally withdrew from the industry right after the show. I was trying to find a way to be just an actor instead of big celebrity as well as I wasn't a fan of doing press, red carpets, etc."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKaRqbWiuoytmLKkn6d6tbTOppisZZikuqZ5yKanq6emmrqmutNmmpqrpGK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF51qGcp2WYmnqjscKapJ5lpJqyr3nHnpirrKSdv7Cujg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjonathan-taylor-thomas-home-improvement-cast-relationship-when-he-became-teen-heartthrob.html&text=Did%20Jonathan%20Taylor%20Thomas%27%20Home%20Improvement%20Co-Stars%20Treat%20Him%20Differently%20When%20He%20Became%20A%20Teen%20He&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjonathan-taylor-thomas-home-improvement-cast-relationship-when-he-became-teen-heartthrob.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjonathan-taylor-thomas-home-improvement-cast-relationship-when-he-became-teen-heartthrob.html&title=Did%20Jonathan%20Taylor%20Thomas%27%20Home%20Improvement%20Co-Stars%20Treat%20Him%20Differently%20When%20He%20Became%20A%20Teen%20He" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjonathan-taylor-thomas-home-improvement-cast-relationship-when-he-became-teen-heartthrob.html&title=Did%20Jonathan%20Taylor%20Thomas%27%20Home%20Improvement%20Co-Stars%20Treat%20Him%20Differently%20When%20He%20Became%20A%20Teen%20He" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjonathan-taylor-thomas-home-improvement-cast-relationship-when-he-became-teen-heartthrob.html&title=Did%20Jonathan%20Taylor%20Thomas%27%20Home%20Improvement%20Co-Stars%20Treat%20Him%20Differently%20When%20He%20Became%20A%20Teen%20He" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjonathan-taylor-thomas-home-improvement-cast-relationship-when-he-became-teen-heartthrob.html&description=Did%20Jonathan%20Taylor%20Thomas%27%20Home%20Improvement%20Co-Stars%20Treat%20Him%20Differently%20When%20He%20Became%20A%20Teen%20He" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-frankie-paul-net-worth-salary-from-tiktok-fame.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Taylor Frankie Paul Make Nearly As Much From Her TikTok Fame As Fans Might Think?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-youre-next-about-origin-true-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cult Classic You're Next Is Actually Way More Relatable Than It Appears">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
