Many of her postings have been about working out, offering fans a behind-the-scenes look at how she prepares for the production of Captain Marvel 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last time, <a href=#>it was all about Frodo's feet</a>. Fans can't get enough of Brie Larson's birthday images, which she shared on Instagram. The actress appears to have huge feet in one of the images, which were quickly likened by fans to those of Frodo from the Lord of the Rings movie. “Your feet 31 too,” wrote one Instagram user, earning a thousand likes.</p><p>Other fans, on the other hand, point out that Larson's feet are unlikely to be that large in real life. The picture would be distorted due to the angle at which the shot was taken and the lens utilized. Despite this, several fans were able to make a hole in the Frodo equation.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Is Obsessed With Brie Larson’s Muscles As She Flaunts Archery Skills</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The comments about Brie’s physical appearance did not stop there. As she continues to share photos on social media, many people still can’t get over her feet – calling them a little strange looking. A Twitter user posted, “Brie Larson stop posting ur feet there are weird people on the internet,” and another chimed in, “Why is brie larson obsessed with showing us her feet?”</p><p>Her fan also wrote, “Brie Larson I would take a bullet for you but, respectfully, who is paying you to keep posting ur feet on Instagram pls I cant take it anymore.” Another shared, “I’ve been thinking about this all day. I have nothing against Brie Larson. I normally think all feet are ugly and I don’t criticize the shape of her toes, we all have different shaped toes. But girl, those nails are not healthy. I want to forget this.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the amount of attention the images received, Brie probably felt compelled to share a photo of her feet. She has also <a href=#>updated her YouTube channel with workout related videos</a>, showing off how confident she is amid criticisms.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here’s Why Brie Larson Lied About Her MCU Role</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-what-does-brie-think-about-beauty-standards>But What Does Brie Think About Beauty Standards?</h2><p>Brie seems unconcerned with the many comments left on her social media posts. And it could be because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has overcome issues about beauty standards</a> by realizing that she could be anyone she wanted “to be with” herself and found peace in that realization.</p><p>In an interview with W magazine in 2020, Brie revealed, “I don’t believe that there is a beauty standard. I struggled with feeling ugly and like an outcast for so much of my life. And so I really, really feel for that. It took me a long time to be able to be totally comfortable with myself.”</p><p>The Captain Marvel actress stated she was able to find peace in herself despite her insecurities. She said, “The thing that has brought me solace is knowing that I can be whoever I want to be with myself. What breaks my heart is to think of people in the world who don’t feel that they have safety within their own bodies.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brie is now putting her best foot forward to aid people who do not have the same luck as her. She explained, “That, to me, is my ultimate goal in life: To do whatever it is that I can so people have the freedom to express themselves and be exactly who it is that they want to be – whatever that is – knowing that that can also change.”</p><p>Brie Larson has risen to become one of Hollywood's most in-demand and beloved actresses in recent years. She is well-known not only for Room and Captain Marvel but also for her activism and advocacy work since she has frequently utilized her celebrity position to highlight political and social problems.</p><p>Unfortunately for fans of her work, the actress doesn't have many other projects in the works, and her next appearance on the big screen is expected to be in the second installment of Captain Marvel, which is presently planned for release in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Fans Mess With Brie Larson For Asking Them Hypothetical ‘WYD?’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dl7a7rdGrnGaqlZbAsLqMn5inq12Wv6Z5wJuqqKSlqbKtxYyomaydo6iypXnWoquhZZKntqZ5y5qprKeeqHqnscStZGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-bizarre-reason-fans-are-absolutely-obsessed-with-brie-larsons-feet.html&text=The%20Bizarre%20Reason%20Fans%20Are%20Absolutely%20Obsessed%20With%20Brie%20Larson%27s%20Feet%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-bizarre-reason-fans-are-absolutely-obsessed-with-brie-larsons-feet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-bizarre-reason-fans-are-absolutely-obsessed-with-brie-larsons-feet.html&title=The%20Bizarre%20Reason%20Fans%20Are%20Absolutely%20Obsessed%20With%20Brie%20Larson%27s%20Feet%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-bizarre-reason-fans-are-absolutely-obsessed-with-brie-larsons-feet.html&title=The%20Bizarre%20Reason%20Fans%20Are%20Absolutely%20Obsessed%20With%20Brie%20Larson%27s%20Feet%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-bizarre-reason-fans-are-absolutely-obsessed-with-brie-larsons-feet.html&title=The%20Bizarre%20Reason%20Fans%20Are%20Absolutely%20Obsessed%20With%20Brie%20Larson%27s%20Feet%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-bizarre-reason-fans-are-absolutely-obsessed-with-brie-larsons-feet.html&description=The%20Bizarre%20Reason%20Fans%20Are%20Absolutely%20Obsessed%20With%20Brie%20Larson%27s%20Feet%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-mars-family-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Mars Family Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./taylor-swift-pear-stud-earrings-amazon-fashion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swift Has Been Wearing Pear Earrings  Get the Look">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
