After months of speculation, however, the Pirates dealt Cole, their No. 1 starter and former No. 1 overall pick. This was to the Astros for right-hander Joe Musgrove, third baseman Colin Moran, reliever Michael Feliz, and outfield prospect Jason Martin.</p><p>General manager Neal Huntington said he expects Musgrove, Moran, and Feliz to contribute in the Majors this season. Musgrove will join Pittsburgh’s rotation. Moran will be a regular at third base. Feliz will bring a big, albeit unproven, arm to the Bucs’ bullpen.</p><p>“This was in our mind the best mix of the roof, fit and folks who happen to be Major League-prepared,” Huntington said. On the last day of the Winter Meetings, Huntington showed the Pirates had not yet chosen whether to reload for next season or retool for 2019 and past.</p><p>Managing Cole demonstrates they are organizing the future, yet preparing MLB players consequently causes it to appear as though they are not completely abandoning the present, either.</p><p>The Pirates did not bargain Cole for youthful prospects who are years from the major associations as they may have in a full tear-down and remake. They rather added to the current youthful center in Pittsburgh, planning to contend soon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gerrit-cole-astros></span><span>Gerrit Cole Astros</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cole was traded by the Pirates to the Houston Astros for Joe Musgrove, Michael Feliz, Colin Moran, and Jason Martin. He and the Astros dipped a bit in late July – early August due to team injuries, but wound up winning the American League West by 6 games and sent Cole to his third career postseason appearance.</p><p>His first start with the Astros, however, came on April 1, 2018, against the Texas Rangers, where he pitched 7 innings, striking out 11, and allowing one run as the Astros won 8-2.</p><p>Furthermore, he struck out 12 hitters in a game against the Oakland Athletics that resulted in a no-decision but an Astros win. Citing this, he broke the Astros strikeout record for April with 61 strikeouts in the first month.</p><p>Besides, he finished his first month in an Astros uniform going 2-1 with 61 strikeouts and a 1.73 ERA in 41.2 innings pitched. On May 4, against the Arizona Diamondbacks Cole struck out 16, allowed only one hit, and pitched his first career shutout as the Astros won 8–0.</p><p>Most noteworthy, his first postseason appearance as an Astro, Cole dominated, striking out 12 Indians’ hitters and walking none in 7 innings in a 3-1 victory in Game 2 of the ALDS.<br>Prior to this, he became just the second pitcher in Major League history to strike out at least 12 hitters with no walks in the postseason.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gerrit-cole-yankees></span><span>Gerrit Cole Yankees</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Yankees had a long haul plan in the back of their psyches Wednesday when they apparently squandered their twentieth round draft pick choosing Al Leiter’s child.</p><p>Delbarton School right-hander Jack Leiter (and partner of Yanks top pick Anthony Volpe) presumably was the best prep pitcher in New Jersey this year and he certainly would have been drafted in the initial two rounds on the off chance that he and his father hadn’t told the world that he’s 99 percent sure he’ll respect his duty to play school ball at Vanderbilt.</p><p>Yankees exploring executive Damon Oppenheimer rolled the shakers, in any case, trusting that 1 percent transforms into a triumphant lottery ticket for Leiter, whose father won 162 major class games as a left-hander who pitched for both New York clubs in addition to the Blue Jays and Marlins in a 19-year vocation.</p><p>In any case, he was drafted by the Yanks 28th generally in 2008 as a prep star. Notwithstanding, he picked to play school ball at UCLA as opposed to turning ace.</p><p>Rather than being disturbed about not marking a first-rounder, Oppenheimer for quite a long time kept in contact with the group of Cole, who was drafted again in 2011 first by and large by Pittsburgh and formed into a star for the Pirates and being managed to the Astros in January 2019 (after the Yankees’ best exchange offer was rejected).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gerrit-cole-pirates></span><span>Gerrit Cole Pirates</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Pirates exchanged top starter Gerrit Cole on Saturday, yet don’t appear to be prepared for a total remake presently.</p><p>Following quite a while of hypothesis, the Pirates managed Cole, their No. 1 starter and previous No. 1 by and large pick, to the Astros for right-hander Joe Musgrove, third baseman Colin Moran, reliever Michael Feliz, and outfield prospect Jason Martin.</p><p>General director Neal Huntington said he expects Musgrove, Moran, and Feliz to contribute in the Majors this season. Musgrove will join Pittsburgh’s pivot. Moran will be a standard at third base. Feliz will bring a major, but dubious, arm to the Bucs’ warm-up area.</p><p>“This was in our mind the best mix of the roof, fit and folks who happen to be Major League-prepared,” Huntington said.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gerrit-cole-era></span><span>Gerrit Cole Era</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cole’s fastball is definitive kryptonite for the dispatch edge unrest assuming control over baseball. The most ideal approach to battle an uppercut swing is to keep the ball high in the zone. He uses a knuckle-curve, slider and change-up to complement his fastball, the slider mostly for right-handed batters and the curve for lefties.</p><p>The former is holding right-handed hitters to a .175 average with 21 strikeouts in 63 at-bats ending on the pitch but the latter is yielding a .375 average to left-handed hitters, so there is clearly some work to be done. However, his knuckle curve does have the added benefit of inducing a lot of ground balls (career-high 65 percent of balls put in play).</p><p>You should expect Cole’s dominance to continue as long as he continues to feature the four-seam fastball up in the zone, and if he does we should see him become the best strikeout pitcher in more than a decade.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-gerrit-cole></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Gerrit Cole</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-cole></span>Who is Cole?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Gerrit is one of America’s best-known and loved baseball pitchers.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-cole></span>How old is Cole?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Gerrit is 29 years of age as of 2019.
