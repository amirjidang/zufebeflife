The series has been known to do parodies of many movies such as <a href=#>Stars Wars</a> (despite<a href=#> making George Lucas uncomfortable</a>). We have also had the <a href=#>opportunity to witness cameos from celebrities over the seasons</a>, some of which fans may have missed out on. Despite the series having undergone some controversy for being offensive, we can’t deny that they do create episodes based on worldwide issues. Family Guy was the <a href=#>first adult-animated series to take on the struggles of a pandemic</a>, which helped educate viewers about the current Covid-19 pandemic the world is going through. The controversy Family Guy has faced is because many viewers find some characters to be very offensive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brian-griffin><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Brian Griffin</span></h2><p>First up on the list is the family dog, Brian Griffin. Brian started out as the only sane member of the Griffin family before tuning into a disgraceful and devious character. Brian came across as creepy when he had an affair with Lois while in Peter’s body. This turned many fans who used like Brian into hating the character.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Sweetest Stewie And Brian Moments In 'Family Guy'</a></span></p><h2 id=carter-pewterschmidt><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Carter Pewterschmidt</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Next up on the list is Lois' wealthy father Carter Pewterschmidt. Carter comes across as racist, homophobic, and brutal by viewers. He always puts his money and wealth first before his own family. Carter is very bitter towards Lois and has a strong dislike toward Lois’ husband Peter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Does An Episode Of 'Family Guy' Cost To Make?</a></span></p><h2 id=bonnie-swanson><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bonnie Swanson</span></h2><p>Bonnie Swanson becomes an unfaithful wife to her husband Joe after he becomes paralyzed. Bonnie requests for Joe's consent to go on to have affairs with other men. However, Bonnie has affairs with men that Joe knows and is friends with. This is what comes across as creepy and made Bonnie such a problematic character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=peter-griffin><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Peter Griffin</span></h2><p>Peter Griffin was originally created to be a deplorable and hopeless character on Family Guy. He became very tone-deaf and was a difficult character for many viewers to connect with. However, Peter did grow to become quite disturbing later in the series when the show. When Peter opened his own restaurant, ‘Big Pete’s House of Munch’, he quickly made a ‘No Legs, No Services’ sign. Peter believed the handicapped people would make the restaurant “less cool”. Peter’s refusal to serve those with a disability came across as very offensive and did not sit well with viewers. It got even worse when Peter went as far as to push his friend Joe out of his wheelchair and call him “crippled”. Peter Griffin’s attitude towards those handicapped does not send a positive message to viewers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Family Guy: 16 Wild Revelations About Peter And Lois’ Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=lois-griffin><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lois Griffin</span></h2><p>Lois Griffin comes across as an offensive character based on how poorly she does being a parent. She started out as a boring and goody-two-shoes housewife before transforming into someone really irresponsible. She joined in with Peter to bully their daughter Meg, and she also found no harm in drugging her own child.</p><h2 id=john-herbert><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>John Herbert</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>John Herbert is an obvious pedophile with a keen interest in Chris Griffin. Those who watch the show can not help but cringe when he appears on the screen. They find John's interest in young children to come across as very unsettling. The characters' pursuit of young children is a common problem that occurs in real-life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which 'Family Guy' Star Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=dr-elmer-hartman><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Dr. Elmer Hartman</span></h2><p>Family Guy fans find Dr Hartman to be one of the most frustrating and scary characters on the show. He is incredibly incompetent and uses misleading words when diagnosing his patients. He accidentally left his cell phone in Joe’s back which caused him to be quadriplegic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stewie-griffin><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Stewie Griffin</span></h2><p>Stewie is one of the most well-loved characters on Family Guy and worth caring about. However, Stewie's actions are also quite offensive. There was an episode where Stewie traveled back in time with Brian to save Mort Goldman from the Nazis. This episode involves Stewie and many other characters using stereotypical jokes towards Jewish people.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> What Happens To 'Family Guy' If Seth McFarlane Leaves Fox?</a></span></p><h2 id=loretta-brown><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Loretta Brown</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Loretta Brown has enabled very sketchy characters traits. One, in particular, that does not sit well with viewers is why she left her husband Cleveland. This is what led Loretta to have an affair with Quagmire and fans found their relationship to be very creepy and unsettling. After the affair, she tried to win back Cleveland, but he found enough courage to let her go and say no to his now ex-wife.</p><h2 id=glen-quagmire><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Glen Quagmire</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last on the list is one of the most offensive characters on Family, Glen Quagmire, or “Quagmire”. Creator Seth MacFarlane and his team purposely made the character Quagmire an obvious sexual predator. He is an established sex criminal after sleeping with a teenager he met from Peter Griffin’s party who lied to him about her age. Quagmire has also tried to hit on Lois Griffin multiple times throughout the series despite her being married to Peter. Quagmire is the epitome of why the #MeToo era was necessary.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The 'Family Guy' Episode That Was Banned From TV</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmedOhnGaln6jBbrvFn5ynq5mrsm6ywKagpbFdnMK6ecKhmKuZk6mys7%2BO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-the-most-offensive-family-guy-characters.html&text=These%20Are%20The%20Most%20Offensive%20Family%20Guy%20Characters%20Of%20All%20Time&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-the-most-offensive-family-guy-characters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-the-most-offensive-family-guy-characters.html&title=These%20Are%20The%20Most%20Offensive%20Family%20Guy%20Characters%20Of%20All%20Time" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-are-the-most-offensive-family-guy-characters.html&title=These%20Are%20The%20Most%20Offensive%20Family%20Guy%20Characters%20Of%20All%20Time" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-the-most-offensive-family-guy-characters.html&title=These%20Are%20The%20Most%20Offensive%20Family%20Guy%20Characters%20Of%20All%20Time" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-the-most-offensive-family-guy-characters.html&description=These%20Are%20The%20Most%20Offensive%20Family%20Guy%20Characters%20Of%20All%20Time" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fan-theory-why-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-broke-up.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Fan Theory Perfectly Explains Why Brad Pitt And Jennifer Aniston Didn't Work Out">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-truth-about-christoper-mintz-plasses-relationship-with-succession-star-nicholas-braun.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Truth About Christoper Mintz-Plasse's Relationship With 'Succession' Star Nicholas Braun ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
