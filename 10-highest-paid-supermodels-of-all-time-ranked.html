She was discovered in a post office in Paris, by a photographer who took her to an agency. It didn't take long until she started working. Brinkley was the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition for three consecutive years. This work made her a household name, and she is still recognized for it.</p><p>Brinkley was on several commercials and billboards around the world. However, most of her fortune comes from real estate investments.

Although she was shorter compared to other models ( 5 ft 7"), Moss changed the fashion industry. Unlike most of the supermodels in the '90s, Moss had no curves, and it was the start of the <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">heroin chic era</a>.</p><p>She started her career when she was only 14 years old after someone discovered her at JFK airport. Moss is one of the most famous models of her generation and now has a model agency.
