A perfect example of that is the fact that there was a lot of excitement because fans knew <a href=#>Teigen was expecting a baby in 2023</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similarly, it was big news when Teigen revealed that she recently briefly believed she had an identical twin. While Teigen's belief she had a twin turned out to be wrong, there is no doubt that the supermodel has a sister named Tina Teigen.</p><h2 id=why-did-chrissy-teigen-think-she-had-an-identical-twin>Why Did Chrissy Teigen Think She Had An Identical Twin?</h2><p>Throughout most of history, anyone who wanted to know where they came from could only ask their parents. Aside from the people whose entire family is from a single area, everyone else could only hope that their parents remembered their background accurately.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chrissy-teigen-and-john-legend-s-family-photo.jpg><p>Over the last several years, all that has been changing because several ancestry companies have popped up. These days, all that anyone who wants to accurately know about their genetic background has to do is pay a fee and send a DNA sample to one of those companies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of people being able to learn more about where their relatives came from, many ancestry companies can also inform customers about their family's medical history. Because of that latter service, Chrissy Teigen found herself in a shocking situation in June 2023.</p><p>On June 5th, 2023, Teigen uploaded a video on Instagram where she spoke about what she'd been through in the preceding 24 hours. As Teigen explained, she suddenly found herself questioning a lot about her past after getting results from an ancestry company.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is How Much Chrissy Teigen Really Spent On Her Eyebrow Transplant</a></span></p><p>At the start of Teigen's Instagram video, she explains that she has been on a journey of self-discovery in recent months. For her, that has meant that she has wanted to learn more about her own health and where her family is from.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After speaking to her therapist and doctor, Teigen decided to sign up for 23andMe's services. As Teigen explained in her video, she'd previously used 23andMe's service to find out about her ancestry but this time she paid to learn more about her health.</p><p>According to Teigen, she started "spiraling" after getting her 23andMe results which revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has an identical twin sister she knew nothing about</a>. As Teigen described in her Instagram video, she called her dad to question him about the situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chrissy-teigen-with-her-dad-ron-teigen-sr.jpg><p>“I call my dad and I literally say, ‘Dad, hey, did you see me come out of Mom’s vagina and were there two of me?' He starts laughing and saying, ‘No, I was there. There were not two of you.’ I’m like, ‘Are you sure you were there?'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evidently, Teigen's father saying that she didn't have a twin sister wasn't enough confirmation for her. Perhaps Teigen thought that, unlike Lisa Marie Presley's ex Michael Lockwood who <a href=#>gets along with their twin daughters</a>, her parents thought having twins would be too much. Either way, Teigen called her sister Tina Teigen to talk to her about her 23andMe results.</p><p>As Teigen explained in her Instagram video, she told her sister what was going on and then asked if she had a twin. Instead of Tina Teigen laughing or instantly saying no, Teigen says her sister reacted to that question by letting out a big gasp.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Heartbreaking Truth About Honey Boo Boo's Older Sister Chickadee's Diagnosis</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Teigen heard her sister gasp, she briefly thought that was confirmation she had a secret twin and her mind started racing. “At this point, I’m making excuses for my whole life. This is why I’m co-dependent, because my twin was ripped away from me. I’ve always felt something missing, and this is why I have addiction issues.”</p><p>In reality, Tina Teigen didn't gasp because she was shocked that a massive family secret was coming out. Instead, Tina Teigen gasped because she instantly understood the hilarious reason behind Teigen's mistaken belief she had a twin.</p><p>Since Teigen has been a celebrity for many years now, she has gotten the chance to have some fascinating experiences. One example of that is Teigen once was asked to appear on the show Finding Your Roots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chrissy-teigen-wearing-a-designer-dress.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Teigen revealed in her Instagram video, her episode of Finding Your Roots didn't air, and they stopped filming partway through the process. However, by that point, the show's production staff had sent in her DNA sample for testing.</p><p>Because Finding Your Roots didn't want any of their guest's genetic tests to leak before each episode aired, they sent samples under fake names. Since Teigen's second sample was sent under her real name, 23andMe had no way of knowing the two samples were from the same person.</p><p>At the end of Teigen's Instagram video, she hilariously remarked. “My identical twin was myself. I was matching myself.”</p><h2 id=who-is-chrissy-teigen-39-s-sister-tina-teigen>Who Is Chrissy Teigen's Sister Tina Teigen?</h2><p>Ever since Chrissy Teigen rose to fame, she has made it clear that family is extremely important to her. With that in mind, Teigen probably wishes she had <a href=#>five sisters like Jenna Ortega</a> but she takes a lot of pleasure in the family she does have. After all, Teigen consistently shares photos of herself with her husband, kids, mom, father, and her sister Tina on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lost Star Daniel Dae Kim's Secret Family Tragedy Is Heartbreaking And Infuriating</a></span></p><p>Since Teigen is so supportive of her family, fans have learned several facts about her sister Tina Teigen. First off, the most basic fact about Tina Teigen that has come to light is she is Teigen's older half-sister.</p><p>In the past, Teigen also shared the news that Tina Teigen got married to a motivational speaker named Corey Speaks. Sadly, Tina Teigen's marriage didn't last, but she appears to be on good terms with her ex who co-parents their daughter Pasha.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chrissy-teigen-with-her-sister-tina-teigen-and-her-mom-vilailuck-teigen-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Tina Teigen isn't busy taking care of her daughter Pasha, she has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seen on TV with her famous family</a> in the past. A perfect example of that is Tina Teigen joining her family sister's team when she competed on Celebrity Family Feud.</p><p>Tina Teigen also appeared with her mom when she had a 2021 Food Network special called Getting Spicy with Pepper Teigen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqMC6edOeoKCdnmK2pbHNraCcmZxiwbi1zWaqoqukmr9uwMinmGaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchrissy-teigen-identical-twin-sister-tina-relationship.html&text=Chrissy%20Teigen%20May%20Not%20Have%20An%20Identical%20Twin%2c%20But%20She%20Does%20Have%20A%20Sister%3a%20Here%27s%20The%20Truth%20About%20He&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchrissy-teigen-identical-twin-sister-tina-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchrissy-teigen-identical-twin-sister-tina-relationship.html&title=Chrissy%20Teigen%20May%20Not%20Have%20An%20Identical%20Twin%2c%20But%20She%20Does%20Have%20A%20Sister%3a%20Here%27s%20The%20Truth%20About%20He" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchrissy-teigen-identical-twin-sister-tina-relationship.html&title=Chrissy%20Teigen%20May%20Not%20Have%20An%20Identical%20Twin%2c%20But%20She%20Does%20Have%20A%20Sister%3a%20Here%27s%20The%20Truth%20About%20He" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchrissy-teigen-identical-twin-sister-tina-relationship.html&title=Chrissy%20Teigen%20May%20Not%20Have%20An%20Identical%20Twin%2c%20But%20She%20Does%20Have%20A%20Sister%3a%20Here%27s%20The%20Truth%20About%20He" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchrissy-teigen-identical-twin-sister-tina-relationship.html&description=Chrissy%20Teigen%20May%20Not%20Have%20An%20Identical%20Twin%2c%20But%20She%20Does%20Have%20A%20Sister%3a%20Here%27s%20The%20Truth%20About%20He" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./diane-keaton-biography-facts-net-worth-married-husband-age-wiki-tv-shows-salary-height-family-books-awards-movies-children-brother.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diane Keaton Biography, Facts, Net Worth, Married, Husband, Age, Wiki, TV Shows, Salary, Height, Fam">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chris-archer-wife-is-chris-archer-married.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Archer Wife: Is Chris Archer Married?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
