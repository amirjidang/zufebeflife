In April 2024, Mike Myers told Entertainment Tonight that <strong>there might be a fourth Austin Powers movie</strong>, which was great news for fans who have been patiently waiting since the early 2000s.</p><p>In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>how a fourth Austin Powers movie could increase Mike Myers' net worth </strong>along with how much money he made from the last three movies. We'll also look at why he wanted to create this quirky franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mike-myers-could-add-to-his-net-worth-if-a-fourth-austin-powers-movie-is-made>Mike Myers Could Add To His Net Worth If A Fourth Austin Powers Movie Is Made</h2><p><strong>Mike Myers has a $200 million net worth</strong>, according to Celebrity Net Worth, and he made most of his money from the Austin Powers franchise. Celebrity Net Worth reported that after <strong>Myers was paid $3.5 million to star in the first Austin Powers</strong>, he made $7 million for the sequel. <strong>Myers was paid a $25 million salary</strong> for Austin Powers in Goldmember. Entertainment Weekly reported that the actor had a particularly sweet deal for the third movie since he got $25 million against 21% of the movie's gross.</p><p>Since the star's salary was increased so much for the third movie in the popular franchise, it seems likely that if there is a fourth Austin Powers movie, Myers would be paid even more money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mike-myerss.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In his April 2024 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Mike Myers said of the film:</p><p>"I can neither confirm nor deny the existence or non-existence of such a project."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Austin-powers-international-man-of-mystery.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What These 8 'Austin Powers' Cast Members Have Done Since Their Roles In The Films</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The cast of the Austin Powers film series has been pretty busy since their roles ended.</span><p>As Entertainment Weekly noted, the actor has talked about wanting to make another Austin Powers movie for several years now. Since he is so committed to the franchise, it's definitely possible that it will happen. While it's unclear what his salary would be, it does seem likely that his fourth film salary could be much higher than what he earned before. Since<strong> Myers created the Austin Powers franchise</strong> and also wrote and produced the past three movies, that would increase his earning potential.</p><p>In 2018, he told E! News:</p><p>"It's looking good, it's just tough, you know, it takes a long time to write the script, you want it to be fantastic. I have three kids under the age of seven now, you know, [director] Jay [Roach] is just back to back making movies. But we've met and, I don't know, it's looking good, we'll see.

According to Forbes, many people think that the first movie did poorly at the box office because it played in 2,115 movie theaters opening weekend and grossed $9.5 million. After its theatrical run, it earned $67.8 million globally.

It also must have been satisfying to see the movies become such a success since he had such a personal connection to them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/austin-powers.jpg><p>In an Austin Powers oral history published by The Hollywood Reporter, the actor said he wrote the screenplay for the first movie quickly and after only two weeks, he was done. He explained:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"After my dad died in 1991, I was taking stock of his influence on me as a person and his influence on me with comedy in general.
