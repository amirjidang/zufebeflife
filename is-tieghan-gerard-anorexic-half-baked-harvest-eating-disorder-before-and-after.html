Half Baked Harvest Before And After<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tieghan Gerard might be in the midst of an active eating disorder, and looking at her recent photos; she displays the signs of an anorexic person.&nbsp;</p><p>The Reddit community is concerned that Tieghan Gerard has ED and is refusing treatment. It also raises questions if anyone is willing to help her with the issues at hand.</p><p>Gerard, however, is yet to come out with her health problems which are fair considering all the backlash social media can give.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-tieghn-gerard-anorexic-ed-and-health-issues></span>Is Tieghn Gerard Anorexic? ED and Health Issues<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Gerard has never openly talked about having an ED. However, Gerard never tastes the food she makes, and an anorexic person tends to resist eating to maintain weight.</p><p>She looks gaunt and is not eating or being nourished by the food she’s spent so much time styling and photographing.</p><p>It is disrespectful and offensive to talk about her mental health issues without her coming out of her comfort zone. So, social media has raised questions regarding helping her to open up.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, Tieghan might be well with no anorexia and such. She might just be looking out for herself and her following healthy habits.</p><p>Some blog chefs and bakers tend to prepare food online and not taste them during the video. They focus their content on presentation and recipes while others taste their food and give feedback. Viewers may find grading or comment on the self-prepared food somewhat over the top or overrated.</p><p>Tieghan also is one of those more concerned about the process and recipe than the taste motivating the viewers to try out the ingredients in their way.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-tieghan-gerard-skinny-weight-and-thin-photos></span>Is Tieghan Gerard Skinny? Weight and Thin Photos<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>It is absurd how people have been judging Tieghan about her weight. Going through her Ig photos, she is skinny but by choice.&nbsp;</p><p>Gerard stands on the beach in a baggy sweater on a family vacation to Cabo. At the same time, everyone else is dressed in swimsuits or sundresses, which may indicate that she is uncomfortable in her skin, but that is not the case but a preference.</p><p>Tieghan Gerard weighs around 51 kg with a height of 5 feet and 5 inches. Considering Gerard is 29 years old, she has a BMI value of 18.6.</p><p>The BMI of around 19 is not flawed and is just about average for a female her age. That shows Tieghan Gerard is not too skinny for her height and age.</p><p>Scrolling through her Instagram account under the handle @halfbakedharvest will result in very few photos of her.</p><p>She also has a Necessaire skincare sponsored series of stories where she talks about how great it is for her skin. Her use of a filter for the skin care products she sells is visible in the photos.</p><h2 id=insight-on-tieghan-gerard-husband-and-family><span class=ez-toc-section id=inside-tieghan-gerards-husband-and-family-life></span> Inside Tieghan Gerard’s Husband And Family Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to her blog, dated back April 12, 2020, Tieghan Gerard was unmarried and did not have a husband. The 27-year-old comes from a large family and is one of seven children, so there are quite a few members in her family.</p><p>Gerard’s family packed up their belongings and moved to Colorado, where they still live when she was 14. She now lives beside her family in her own home alone, which she has converted from a horse barn to suit her needs.&nbsp;</p><p>She was the only girl for fifteen years before her mother had Asher. With a large family, cooking meals always becomes a war zone. Tieghan started helping cook to alleviate some of the mealtime chaos and get dinner on the table at a reasonable hour.&nbsp;</p><p>Gerard quickly realized how much she enjoyed the process as she learned the ins and out of the trade.</p><p>Before long, she had taken over full-time cooking duties for her family, and Half Baked Harvest was born after she photographed the process and documented her favorite recipes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=m-0><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-tieghan-gerard-have-an-eating-disorder></span>Does Tieghan Gerard have an eating disorder?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tieghan Gerard is yet to open up if she has an eating disorder.
