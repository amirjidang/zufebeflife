Two very notable band members are the lead singers Stevie Nicks (who has gone on to <a href=#>collaborate with many big-name stars including Miley Cyrus</a>) and Lindsey Buckingham. While many fans of the rock band knew Stevie and Lindsey were a couple at the time, many do not realize just how complicated their relationship really was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Fleetwood Mac Members Have Passed Away?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-it-all-began-for-stevie-nicks-and-lindsey-buckingham>How It All Began For Stevie Nicks And Lindsey Buckingham</h2><p>Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham were both seniors in high school when they first met. Lindsey had started up a rock band, Fritz, in the early years of high school. When a member of the band left for college, Lindsey was in search of a new lead singer. This is when Lindsey met Stevie when she auditioned to be the lead singer for the band and got the gig. Lindsey and Stevie did not become a couple right away. They started out as bandmates and friends with a mutual interest in music. When Fritz broke up, Stevie and Lindsey moved to Los Angeles to take their musical career more seriously. It came as no surprise that shortly after the move, their relationship became suddenly more romantic and thys the start of their tumultuous relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham started their journey in Los Angeles as a duo rock band called Buckingham Nicks and released an eponymous album. The album cover consisted of an iconic photo of them topless giving them the sexy rock duo persona. The record need up flopping which led their label to have no choice but to drop Stevie and Lindsey. However, this was obviously not the end of the duo as they went on to continue writing music including their hit Landslide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stevie-nicks-and-lindsey-buckingham-join-fleetwood-mac>Stevie Nicks And Lindsey Buckingham Join Fleetwood Mac</h2><p>The original members of Fleetwood Mac, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, and Christine McVie all came across Lindsey Buckingham at a studio. They were impressed with Lindsey’s guitar skills and wanted him to join the band because it would be a great asset for them. However, Lindsey gave them an ultimatum. If they want him [Lindsey], they need to take Stevie Nicks as well because they are a package deal. Fortunately, the Fleetwood Mac members took Lindsey up on the ultimatum and asked Stevie to join the group as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's The Pact Stevie Nicks Made With Christine McVie When Fleetwood Mac Started</a></span></p><p>It took a few days for Lindsey and Stevie to decide if they wanted to join the band or remain a duo. Who could blame them? When it comes down to continuing to struggle as a duo or take a chance and join the band and maybe reach some success, the decision is clear, right? Lindsey and Stevie ultimately decided to take a chance and join Fleetwood Mac. Thankfully for many of the fans, they did, or they would not be the household names they are today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside Harry Styles' Friendship With Fleetwood Mac Frontwoman Stevie Nicks</a></span></p><p>In Stevie’s biography “Gold Dust Woman,” she opened up about that moment and told Lindsey “This is what we’ve been working for since 1968 and you and I have to sew this relationship back up. We have too much to lose here. We need to put our problems behind us. Maybe we’re not going to have any more problems, because we’re finally going to have some money. And I won’t have to be an f— waitress.” When the deal was done and Lindsey and Stevie’s relationship was seemingly back on good terms and going strong, which did not last long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-eventual-breakup-between-stevie-nicks-and-lindsey-buckingham>The Eventual Breakup Between Stevie Nicks And Lindsey Buckingham</h2><p>In 1977 Fleetwood Mac was writing and recording their album Rumours and Stevie and Lindsey ended their relationship. The breakup trends continued on to their bandmates John and Christine McVie, who broke up after being married in 1968. Mick Fleetwood also finalized his divorce with his wife at the time Jenny Boyd only to get remarried and re-divorced to her in 1978. However, great music came out of the breakups including their hit song Dream. Rumours also went on to win a handful of Grammy Awards and still is the bestselling album of all time.</p><p>It came as no surprise when Stevie and Lindsey shot eye daggers at each other during their performances while on tour. Most notable while performing the breakup anthem Silver Springs (a song written by Stevie about her former flame Lindsey) in front of the packed stadiums.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lindsey and Stevie both worked on moving on after their relationship had ended. However, Lindsay had a difficult time meeting a woman who liked him for him. In an interview with the Rolling Stone Stevie said “In Lindsey’s mind, all the other women that came after me were all going after rich rock-and-roll star Lindsey. Nobody was looking into the heart I had looked into. Nobody was seeing the guy before he was famous. We knew each other before. That’s what makes us unique to each other.” Eventually, Lindsey did meet Carol Ann Harris and was in a relationship for eight years and was engaged but never got married. Meanwhile, during his second marriage, Stevie had a short love affair with her bandmate, Mick Fleetwood, in 1977. Yet, the Fleetwood Mac band members managed to remain close as ever on and off the stage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Does Twitter Choose Stevie Wonder Over Stevie Nicks?</a></span></p><p>Stevie moved on to date musicians Don Henley, J.D. Souther and Joe Walsh, all are members of the rock band The Eagles. Stevie also got briefly married in 1983 to Kim Anderson who was a friend of Stevie for the longest time. Kim was previously married to Stevie’s best friend until she, unfortunately, passed away. Stevie and Kim did not last long and did break. Stevie has been unlucky in love since but has admitted in interviews <a href=#>she would date one singer if he was older</a>. When Lindsey and Carol broke up in 1984, he eventually went on to get married to photographer and interior designer Kristen Messner and welcome their son and two daughters. Clearly, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham have gone through some complications during their relationship but at least we got some great music out of it and they both are doing well in their solo careers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Harry Styles And Stevie Nicks: A Look Into A Modern Day Rock And Roll Friendship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoqaUqLK6ecGumqShnpy1ormMrKuerpmaeq%2B1wqSqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGKuo8HSnmY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flindsey-buckingham-stevie-nicks-relationship-abuse.html&text=The%20Truth%20About%20Lindsey%20Buckingham%20And%20Stevie%20Nicks%27%20Complicated%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flindsey-buckingham-stevie-nicks-relationship-abuse.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flindsey-buckingham-stevie-nicks-relationship-abuse.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Lindsey%20Buckingham%20And%20Stevie%20Nicks%27%20Complicated%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flindsey-buckingham-stevie-nicks-relationship-abuse.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Lindsey%20Buckingham%20And%20Stevie%20Nicks%27%20Complicated%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flindsey-buckingham-stevie-nicks-relationship-abuse.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Lindsey%20Buckingham%20And%20Stevie%20Nicks%27%20Complicated%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flindsey-buckingham-stevie-nicks-relationship-abuse.html&description=The%20Truth%20About%20Lindsey%20Buckingham%20And%20Stevie%20Nicks%27%20Complicated%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tiger-woods-accused-of-sexual-harassment-in-exs-million-dollar-lawsuit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tiger Woods Accused Of Sexual Harassment In Exs Million Dollar Lawsuit">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sean-astin-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sean Astin Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
