They both make completely different kinds of music, although fans have been equally obsessed with their hit songs. When Post Malone told his fanbase in March 2024 that he had <strong>recorded a song with Morgan Wallen</strong>, many raised their eyebrows at the news since he never made country music before. People were also surprised because of <a href=#>Wallen's many scandals throughout his career</a>.</p><p>In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>the nature of Post Malone and Morgan Wallen's relationship</strong>, why <strong>fans questioned their collaboration</strong>, and what Post Malone said about venturing into the country genre.</p><h2 id=what-is-post-malone-and-morgan-wallen-39-s-relationship-like>What Is Post Malone And Morgan Wallen's Relationship Like?</h2><p>On March 20th, 2024, Post Malone shared part of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his country song that he recorded with Morgan Wallen</a> on Instagram.

While they could be friends, they don't appear to have said so. Since Post Malone said that he was "proud" to have worked with the country singer, it sounds like they do get along and it was a positive professional relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Which Other Artists Has Post Malone Collaborated With?</p><ul><li>Nicky Jam and Ozuna</li><li>Justin Bieber</li><li>Kanye West</li><li>Kehlani</li><li>Taylor Swift</li></ul><p>At the very least, it's clear that they have known each other for a little while. According to Variety, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the singers performed at the 2023 CMA Awards</a> and sang a tribute song for Joe Diffie.

According to Variety, he said that he was sorry and that he knew he was "wrong." While some would say that it was good that he apologized, others would fairly argue that he should never have said that in the first place. It makes sense that Post Malone's fanbase was curious about his decision to record a song with Wallen, given this scandal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/morgan-wallen-singing.jpg><p>Post Malone didn't seem to comment on the incident.

It seems likely that he chose to work with Wallen because of Wallen's successful place in the country music industry. Since he hasn't commented on Wallen's controversial reputation, it's hard to know what he really thinks about it. It's also possible that the two worked together because <strong>Morgan Wallen is a songwriter </strong>who has penned tunes for other artists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-post-malone-transformed-his-body-and-got-in-shape.jpg><p>According to Us Weekly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Post Malone discussed country music</a> in various interviews over the last few years.
