Though despite the low salary, there are other ways to make some extra bucks, which includes showing up to the 'Survivor' reunion show. Let's take a look at the numbers.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-the-first-eliminated-39-survivor-39-contestant-make>How Much Does The First Eliminated 'Survivor' Contestant Make?</h2><p>Although it is fun to watch on television, former contestants have revealed that joining the reality competition is not easy. Heck, former player Tyson Apostol said getting on the show is a task in itself and only for those that are willing to wait.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's what <a href=#>the former winner said about his experience in getting on the show</a>, "They're like, 'Oh, we'll stay in touch' and 'We'll call you next week,' and then three weeks will go by and they'll text you, 'Sorry, we don't know yet,'" Apostol said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>'Survivor' Favorite Sarah Lacina's Life After Winning Season 34</a></span></p><p>Another contestant would reveal that auditioning in front of Jeff Probst was not easy either, "I was nervous going into the interviews, but I just knew that once I got to talk to these people and tell them a joke or two, or just be myself, it would be OK," Stott told Insider. "... I said, 'Jeff, you're just a man, you put your britches on just like I do.'"</p><p>Getting on the show is another animal in itself. Some of the most in-shape human-beings struggled once they made it on the show, given the conditions matched with the lack of resources to eat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yes, 'Survivor' truly is no walk in the park, nonetheless, the show's longevity is quite remarkable, as it remains on the air after 42 seasons and 616 episodes!</p><p>Fans are still asking questions about some of the things behind the scenes, and that includes the salary of the cast, especially those that leave early.</p><h2 id=the-first-eliminated-39-survivor-39-contestant-doesn-39-t-make-much>The First Eliminated 'Survivor' Contestant Doesn't Make Much</h2><p>Alongside Life Style Mag, former contestant <a href=#>Jonny Fairplay revealed some of the figures from the show</a>, including how much the first contestant to be eliminated makes on the show. Surprisingly, it really isn't much, despite the fact that they're on a high caliber reality show which has made millions throughout its history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is said that the first eliminated player makes a mere $2,500.</p><p>Sure, that might sound low to some, but factor in that their only on the island for a few days. It is basically like they got a paid trip at the end of the day.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Zeke Smith From 'Survivor' Changed The Course For Trans Players</a></span></p><p>The salaries have changed along the way, however, as far as season 1 goes, it is believed that the cast made $85,000 for coming in third place, while fourth place made $70,000. Those eliminated mid-season, are said to make around the $27,000 mark.</p><p>Now contestants can boost their pays, and this takes place at the end of the season during the reunion special. For this part, the show gives out some extra funds.</p><h2 id=how-much-do-other-eliminated-contestants-make-on-39-survivor-39>How Much Do Other Eliminated Contestants Make On 'Survivor'?</h2><p>Ironically, the first eliminated guest can make more money showing up to the reunion than actually playing the game. Sure, talking about being eliminated first might not be the greatest feeling, but if you agree, you'll walk away with $10,000 extra bucks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That number was further enhanced during the Survivor: Winners at War season, with the winner taking home a huge grand-prize of $2 million. In addition, the all star cast was offered $35,000 to return for the reunion show. It turns out 'Survivor' really takes good care of their alums, giving them a big boost in a salary.</p><p>There is money to made, especially for the alums that return to the show - basically the more entertaining you are, the bigger the chance the contestant might be asked to return in the future.</p><p>As for the host Jeff Probst, he continues to sit on a cool salary worth $50 million.
