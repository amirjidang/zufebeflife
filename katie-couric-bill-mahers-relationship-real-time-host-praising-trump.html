They're both known for having strong opinions, whether Couric is <a href=#>spilling about working with Matt Lauer </a>or <a href=#>Maher is criticizing Tucker Carlson</a>. Maher tends to get super honest on his Club Random podcast, like the time when he <a href=#>insulted Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>.</p><p>Since <a href=#><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> has been in the news thanks to his civil fraud trial and 2024 Presidential run, it makes sense that the political figure came up when Couric appeared on Club Random in April 2024. It also makes sense that Maher and Couric <strong>didn't see eye to eye when discussing Trump</strong>. In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>Katie Couric and Bill Maher's relationship before their podcast interview</strong>, along with what Maher said about Trump that upset Couric.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-was-katie-couric-and-bill-maher-39-s-relationship-like-before-she-criticized-him-for-complimenting-donald-trump>What Was Katie Couric And Bill Maher's Relationship Like Before She Criticized Him For Complimenting Donald Trump?</h2><p>While Katie Couric and Bill Maher got into a heated conversation about Donald Trump on his Club Random podcast, the two seem to have a <strong>good relationship with mutual respect</strong>. While neither has said that they have a friendship, there is no indication that they don't like each other, and they didn't have any public fights before their podcast interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bill-maher.jpg><p>It's unclear if Bill Maher and Katie Couric met before she was alarmed that he praised Donald Trump. Based on his comments, it seems that they might have run into each other professionally, but not socially. Maher said:</p><p>"That's the thing about us show people, we only get together when we work."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/donald-trump-regretted-insulting-kim-novak-s-looks-in-an-incredibly-rare-admission-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Donald Trump Regretted Insulting Kim Novak's Looks In An Incredibly Rare Admission</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Donald Trump admitted that he went too far while calling out the Hollywood legend Kim Novak.</span><p><strong>Couric admitted to being a big fan of Maher's, </strong>which was most likely why she wanted to go on Club Random.

Thank you... What a treat, you know... Now I can get you to come and do it with me... So it's like the best thing in the world."</p><p>He added:</p><p>"I can take one, you know, two hour break midweek from my real job at Real Time to just kick it with somebody and now I can call you and you actually come."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/donald-trump.jpg><p>Although they disagreed about Trump, the rest of the conversation was fairly positive, although there were tense and awkward moments when Couric and Maher didn't seem to get along. According to Mediate.com, <strong>Katie Couric</strong><strong>talked about working with Matt Lauer</strong> and said that after one woman opened up about his behavior, they were told it just happened once. When Maher said, “Obviously there was a tradition of an old boys network," Couric said that was true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Who Did Bill Maher Interview On Club Random January 7-April 10 2024?</p></th><th scope=col><p>Date Of Interview (According to Apple Podcasts)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>David Mamet</p></td><td><p>January 7th 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Trace Adkins</p></td><td><p>January 14th 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chris Destefano</p></td><td><p>January 21st 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Martin Short</p></td><td><p>January 28th 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Patrick Bet-David</p></td><td><p>February 4th 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jillian Michaels</p></td><td><p>February 11th 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Whitney Cummings</p></td><td><p>February 18th 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chris Robinson</p></td><td><p>February 25th 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Alan Ritchson</p></td><td><p>March 3rd 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cameron Crowe</p></td><td><p>March 10th 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>John Cleese</p></td><td><p>March 17th 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sheryl Crow</p></td><td><p>March 24th 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Drea de Matteo</p></td><td><p>April 4th 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Billy Dee Williams</p></td><td><p>April 7th 2024</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gina Carano</p></td><td><p>April 10th 2024</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While that part of the podcast went smoothly, Maher wasn't 100 percent supportive when Couric mentioned that when she co-hosted Today with Bryant Gumbel, <strong>he was</strong><strong>harsh about her first pregnancy</strong>. She said, “He got mad at me because I was doing something on maternity leave, and he was giving me endless sh*t for taking a month or two off. I was having my first baby."</p><p>Instead of agreeing that was unfair and mean, Maher said that Gumbel was kidding.
