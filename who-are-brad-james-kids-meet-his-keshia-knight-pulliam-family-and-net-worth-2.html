Brad served in combat units for four years as a U.S. Marine. He spent his time studying Brazilian ju-jitsu, line-training, and hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>Despite his reputation as an athletic actor who can pull off his own stunts, Brad is currently working with an ankle that never fully healed after he injured it in late 2000 while serving in the US Marine Corps.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-net-worth-of-brad-james></span>What is the Net Worth of Brad James?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Brad will be worth $4 million in 2022.

However, the profile hasn’t been updated in a while, so it’s unclear if he still holds these roles.</p><p>James has made numerous appearances in advertisements for well-known companies like Walmart, AutoTrader.com, and BlackBerry. In Maverick Entertainment’s Champion Road, he played the principal character of John Merser in his first acknowledged speaking role on-screen.</p><p>James received Georgia’s “Best Actor” honor in 2013 during the Georgia Entertainment Gala.
