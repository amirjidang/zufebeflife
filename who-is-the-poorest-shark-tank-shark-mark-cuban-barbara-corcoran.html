The show wasn't keen on his history and it is said that his contract offer wasn't the best at the start. Thankfully, it all worked out and the show turned into a must-watch, feel-good story on a weekly basis.

To think that he almost wasn't cast, not only was the network hesitant to bring him in but in addition, they gave an extremely low offer to appear on the show.</p><p>Thanks to leaked emails, Mark's reaction was published to the masses and as you can expect, he was none too pleased. Thankfully, he made it onto the show, and success followed for the program, with no end coming anytime soon.</p><h2 id=robert-and-daymond-are-in-the-middle>Robert And Daymond Are In The Middle</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Robert and Daymond are slacking either when it comes to their net worths.
