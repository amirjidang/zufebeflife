The star sings in English, Pidgin English, and Yoruba; his genre is Afro Hip-hop fusion. With sensational melody and dance moves, no doubt, he has become a force to reckon with in the Nigerian music industry.</p><p>He is controversial as his life on camera is different from his day-to-day life. Contrary to the expectations of the uninformed, Naira Marley&nbsp;is well-educated and a responsible family man who lives according to the tenets of Islam. His popularity, fame, and controversies he has courted have begged the question of who is Naira Marley?</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=profile-summary-of-naira-marley></span><strong>Profile Summary of Naira Marley</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Full Name</strong>: Azeez Adesina&nbsp; Fashola</li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: 10th May 1991</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 31 Years Old</li><li><strong>State of Origin</strong>: Lagos State</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: Nigerian</li><li><strong>Marital Status</strong>: Married</li><li><strong>Profession</strong>: Musician and Songwriter</li><li><strong>Place of Birth</strong>: Agege, Lagos State</li><li><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $1,000,000</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=naira-marley-was-born-31-years-ago-in-lagos-state></span><strong>Naira Marley was Born 31 Years Ago in Lagos State</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Azeez Fashola, also known as Naira Marley, is a 31 years old Nigerian musician, record producer, and songwriter who has dazzled music fans with his melody and music fusion. He hails from Lagos State in South Western Nigeria and was born to Mr. and Mrs. Fashola on 10th May 1991. Marley is not the only child of his parents, as he has several siblings. He is a polygamous man with two wives and is the father of four lovely children (two boys and two girls), who are British citizens, all residing there.</p><p>At age 11, Naira Marly moved to Peckham, South London, England. This is where he spent most of his childhood. He attended Porlock Hall then proceeded to Walworth School in the United Kingdom, where he obtained his General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE). He went further to Peckham Academy, where he obtained a Distinction in Business. His drive for education made him enroll at Crossways College (Now known as Christ the Sixth Form College) and graduate from Business Law. Ironically the “las las school na scam crooner is a well-educated fellow,” it is no wonder to be a senior Marlian, You have to be a graduate of any tertiary institution.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-began-his-music-career-in-2014></span><strong>He Began His Music Career in 2014</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While growing up, Naira Marley had a profound love for music; he always wanted to be a Master of Ceremonies (MC) and a voice-over artist. While he was at Peckham Academy, he managed the rap careers of his MC friends. As he discharged his managerial duties, he discovered his passion and talent for music. His talent did not go unnoticed by his friends, as when they had a song to produce, there was still room for another artist to sing. His friends encouraged him to fill the spot; he did, and it was the beginning of more recordings to come.</p><p>He released his first EP titled “Gotta Dance” in 2015 and began to gain a decent following. By December 2018, Naira Marley collaborated with Olamide and Lil Kesh and released the single titled “Issa Goal.” The song became the official song for the Super Eagles (Nigerian Male National Football Team) during the 2018 FIFA World Cup. He continued singing, and on 16th June 2018, he released the Remix of Issa Goal featuring Falz, Simi, Slimcase, Lil Kesh, and Olamide. At this point, his name had become a household name in the music industry.</p><p>Naira Marley has further released hits like “Am I a Yahoo Boy” (a song that sent him to jail) and the smash hit “Soapy” (which topped the Nigerian charts for 10 weeks). In 2019, he released his second EP, “Lord of Lamba.” His musical career has grown astronomically to the extent that he has a fanatic fan base called “Marlians.” He has a record label Marlian Records, and has signed some upcoming artists to his label.</p><p><strong>Popular Songs by Naira Marley include the following:</strong></p><ul><li>“Tesumole”</li><li>“Opotoyi”</li><li>“Koleyewon”</li><li>“Back to work”</li><li>“Why”</li><li>“Mafo”</li><li>“Puxa”</li><li>“Tingasa”</li></ul><p><strong>EXTENDED PLAY (EP)</strong></p><ul><li>“Gotta Dance” 2015</li><li>“Lord of Lamba” 2019</li></ul><p>His young music career has also not been bereft of awards. At least he has an award to his name which is the:</p><ul><li>Sound City MVP Awards for Viewer’s Choice 2020</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-naira-marleys-father-mr-fashola-who-is-a-successful-businessman></span><strong>Meet Naira Marley’s Father, Mr. Fashola Who is a Successful Businessman</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Not much is known about his family, as the musician is discreet when it comes to family. But we do know he comes from a large family, having a lot of siblings. Mr. Fashola is the father of Naira Marley. He is not a popular man, so very little is known about him. He attended the court hearing in 2019 when his son was charged with credit card fraud.</p><p>He is an ardent supporter of his son but not a social media person. It was gathered that he is a successful businessman who loves and cares for his family exceptionally. Mrs. Fashola is the mother of the prolific artist; like her husband, little is known about her too. She was always with her son in court while he had issues with the authorities.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=naira-marley-has-three-known-younger-siblings></span><strong>Naira Marley Has Three Known Younger Siblings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=shubomi></span><strong>Shubomi</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Real name:</strong> Mariam Fashola</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 21st March 1998</li></ul><p>Mariam Fashola is also known as Iyalode Gbogbo Marlian.
