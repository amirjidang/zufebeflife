So much so that <strong>Joel was invited to Stern's wedding to Beth Ostorsky</strong> on October 3rd, 2008. Joel attended the wedding with <strong>his then-wife, Katie Lee Joel</strong>. This seems to prove that the two couples were close friends and spent time together. Unfortunately,<strong> Joel and Katie Lee divorced less than a year after attending Stern's wedding</strong> to his second and current wife, Beth.</p><ul><li>Billy Joel and Katie Lee Joel were married for 5 years</li><li>Katie Lee is just four years older than Bill Joel's eldest daughter, Alexa Ray Joel, and this caused controversy in their marriage</li><li><a href=#>Katie Lee's current relationship is drastically different</a> than her relationship with Joel</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following Joel's divorce, he struck up a relationship with Alex Roderick.

It seems they are so close that they actually go over to each other's houses.</p><p>While this may not seem like a big deal, it certainly is for Stern. After all, the self-proclaimed King of All Media is a notorious recluse who is extremely picky about who he lets into his inner circle.

This is, in part, because of Joel's epic return to releasing music. Prior to his <strong>2024 release of "Turn The Lights Back On"</strong>, Joel hadn't shared any of his music since 2007. In the days leading up to Joel's appearance with Stern at the SiriusXM Miami studios, the radio legends waxed poetic about his love of the new single.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Stern isn't the only one who loved Joel's return to music.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Billy Joel's "Turn The Lights Back On" Stats</strong></p></td><td><p>According to Billboard and Spotify</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Joel returned to the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time since 1997</p></td><td><p>Ranking #61</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Spotify streams of "Turn The Lights Back On" as of Feb 12th, 2024</p></td><td><p>3,099,920</p></td></tr></tbody></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/billy-joel-refused-to-write-another-song-until-a-surprising-relationship-changed-his-life-front-deposit-back-billy-joel-_youtube.jpg><p>Aside from Billy Joel's new song and whether or not he'll release any more new music, the celebrity friends made headlines for their discussions about Joel's relationships.
