This<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> American reality </a>series was based on the lives of five Hamill members — the couple Michelle and Dan and their kids Jack, Cece, and Cate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All the Hamills have achondroplasia, a rare form of dwarfism that affects only 1 out of 25,000 people in the world. But TLC focused on making the family relatable and showing how these <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘little’ people</a> try to overcome life’s obstacles together like any other family. The cast of this series, with their simplicity and positive attitude, immediately created a significant and long-lasting impression on the audience once the episodes started being aired.</p><h2 id=the-story-of-appearing-on-the-show>The Story Of Appearing On The Show</h2><p>The two seasons of the series Our Little Family had aired 17 episodes in total. Initially, TLC had a plan of doing a show on the professional life of a ‘short-statured architectural woodworker,’ but later, it changed into a family reality series. At first, the producers of the series Our Little Family&nbsp;discovered Dan Hamill on Facebook and got in touch with him. After several phone calls, plans, and a four-minute demo reel footage of the Hamill family’s everyday life, TLC came back with the offer of featuring the entire family in the series instead of highlighting Dan alone. Cindy Kain, TLC’s executive producer, mentioned that the heart and humor that all the five Hamills bring to their daily life and struggles made them decide to have all of them on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Of Our Favorite TLC Shows Of All Time (5 We Wish Never Existed)</a></span></p><h2 id=michelle-and-dan-s-biggest-concerns>Michelle And Dan’s Biggest Concerns</h2><p>Receiving an offer for a show from a leading cable network like TLC is no less than a dream, but Dan and Michelle didn’t jump on it right away. They had in-depth discussions between themselves about accepting the offer. In the beginning, Michelle was a bit hesitant, especially to put her kids in the spotlight. She knew that the show would not work if they would not show the real sides of their characters and their daily lives. Michelle mentioned that her twin daughters were too young to realize that they were being filmed, but she had real apprehensions about her son Jack, what he might face or what people might comment about him. But then Michelle gathered courage and wanted to show the world how a ‘short-statured’ boy of 6 years can grow and be a part of the world, just like every other kid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-hamills-lives-have-changed>The Hamills’ Lives Have Changed</h2><p>The lives of the Hamills have changed a lot after the two seasons of Our Little Family. The family gets recognized every time they walk out of their house. Although Jack Hamill realizes that people got to see him on TV, both the twin girls don’t realize it and imagine how people know their names. Michelle has shared one funny incident related to this. One day when she was coming out of a restaurant, a random guy told her that they were everywhere, including the television and the parking lot. In public places, people often ask them for photographs or selfies.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Our Little Family: 20 Dark Secrets TLC Tried To Bury</a></span></p><p>Dan and Michelle also get requests from people for their autographs. The family seems to enjoy the fame. Apart from these changes, both Michelle and Dan say that some parts of their lives are still the same.&nbsp;While Dan and Michelle, along with their kids Jack, Cece, and Cate, won millions of hearts with their show, they don’t seem to be much active on social media. Our Little Family stars like to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">maintain absolute privacy</a> and keep themselves more productive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Where The Family From 'Little People, Big World' Are Today</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDZquoZaSdsm6vwKyrZqeWYry2voyloK2snJp6p63MoqOyZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheres-what-happened-to-the-cast-of-our-little-family.html&text=Here%27s%20What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Our%20Little%20Family%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-what-happened-to-the-cast-of-our-little-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-what-happened-to-the-cast-of-our-little-family.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Our%20Little%20Family%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheres-what-happened-to-the-cast-of-our-little-family.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Our%20Little%20Family%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheres-what-happened-to-the-cast-of-our-little-family.html&title=Here%27s%20What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Our%20Little%20Family%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-what-happened-to-the-cast-of-our-little-family.html&description=Here%27s%20What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Our%20Little%20Family%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./heres-why-people-think-sandra-bullock-underwent-plastic-surgery.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's Why People Think Sandra Bullock Underwent Plastic Surgery">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./giulio-gallarotti-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-325081-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Giulio Gallarotti Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
