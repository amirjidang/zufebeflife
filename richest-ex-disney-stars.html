With many Disney kids having the ability to both sing and act, there's no shortage of talent when it comes to the company's alumni. Here are the top ten richest celebrities who got their start with Disney.</p><h2 id=joe-jonas---18-million>Joe Jonas - $18 million</h2><p>Actor and singer Joe Jonas&nbsp;teamed up with his brothers Nick and Joe to form a group called The Jonas Brothers when they were kids. They were first signed to Columbia records, but the label ultimately dropped them due to low sales of their first album. Fortunately for them, Hollywood Records - a record label part of the Disney Music Group - picked them up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After&nbsp;starring in the Disney Channel movie Camp Rock, the Jonas Brothers got so big that the media often compared their fanbase to "Beatlemania." Joe had a new band for a time called DNCE, but has recently reunited with his family to start The Jonas Brothers back up.</p><h2 id=zac-efron---24-million>Zac Efron - $24 million</h2><p>Zac Efron's first significant acting role was on the WB show Summerland. It wasn't until he was cast as the lead in the Disney Channel movie High School Musical that he became America's heartthrob. The High School Musical franchise took off - resulting in two sequels - and helped get Zac's foot in the door when it came to being a leading man in feature films.</p><p>Some of the movies Zac has starred in are&nbsp;Hairspray, The Lucky Ones, Neighbors, Baywatch, and The Greatest Showman. His latest role was playing serial killer Ted Bundy. Seems like he was able to shed his wholesome Disney image!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hilary-duff---25-million>Hilary Duff - $25 million</h2><p>Hilary Duff became an "It" girl after being cast as the title role in the Disney Channel show Lizzie McGuire. The show was so successful that there was even a feature film, The Lizzie McGuire Movie. She has since released six successful studio albums and a trilogy of books.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>11 Disney "It" Girls Who Are Still Turning Heads (And 11 Who Have Given Up)</a></span></p><p>As for acting, Hilary has starred in movies like A Cinderella Story, Raise Your&nbsp;Voice, and The Haunting of Sharon Tate. She currently stars on the television show Younger and is gearing up to reprise her role as Lizzie McGuire in an eagerly anticipated reboot!</p><h2 id=nick-jonas---25-million>Nick Jonas - $25 million</h2><p>Alongside his brothers Joe and Kevin, Nick Jonas formed the wildly successful band The Jonas Brothers. After the band found success starring in the Disney Channel movie Camp Rock, the brothers were eventually given their own show called Jonas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Post-Disney, Nick has started up a solo singing career, although he's only just recently reunited with his brothers to release another album under "The Jonas Brothers." Nick also continues to act,&nbsp;scoring roles on TV shows like Smash, Kingdom, and Scream Queens as well as starring in films like Careful What You Wish For and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.</p><h2 id=demi-lovato---33-million>Demi Lovato - $33 million</h2><p>Demi Lovato was a child actor on Barney & Friends before Disney Channel discovered her and cast her in the short series As The Bell Rings. Her powerful vocals helped her land the lead in the TV movie Camp Rock, which was so&nbsp;popular it resulted in a sequel. It also kick-started Demi's career.</p><p>She briefly had her own show on Disney called Sonny With a Chance, but departed the show to seek treatment for&nbsp;issues regarding an eating disorder&nbsp;and drug abuse. Now, Demi advocates for mental health awareness and focuses on her music, having released six successful studio albums.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez---60-million>Selena Gomez - $60 million</h2><p>Selena Gomez actually started as a child actor on Barney & Friends with Demi! Disney then cast her as the star of the sitcom Wizards of Waverly Place, which ran from 2007 to 2012. She also did a few TV movies for Disney and signed on to their music label, Hollywood Records.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>12 Disney Stars Who Are Friends For Life And 9 Who Still Can't Stand Each Other</a></span></p><p>Selena released four wildly successful albums with them before signing to Interscope Records and releasing an album with them. As for acting, Selena has starred in films like Ramona and Beezus, Spring Breakers, and The Dead Don't Die. She's also a UNICEF ambassador.</p><h2 id=ryan-gosling---60-million>Ryan Gosling - $60 million</h2><p>It's hard to believe that movie star <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> was once a little boy starring in the variety show The Mickey Mouse Club! Ryan was a"Mouseketeer" for two years before moving on to other children's shows and movies. It wasn't until he started doing independent films that a fanbase for the heartthrob began to grow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His first starring role was in the film The Believer, but he became a bonafide movie star after his lead role in the epic romance The Notebook. Now, the actor is a Golden Globe winner and&nbsp;has been nominated for Oscars multiple times. Movies of his include La La Land, Drive, The Big Short, Blade Runner 2049, and First Man.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus---160-million>Miley Cyrus - $160 million</h2><p>Seeing as she is the daughter of country star Billy Ray Cyrus, <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> was always in the spotlight. The day she was cast as the lead in the Disney Channel sitcom Hannah Montana, however, was the day she became way more than just "Billy Ray Cyrus's daughter."</p><p>The show lasted for four seasons and, since it centered on a singer, Miley got to record a lot of music for the show. She has since released six studio albums and two EP's and is one of the biggest names in the music industry. As for acting, Miley starred in movies like The Last Song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-spears---215-million>Britney Spears - $215 million</h2><p>Like Ryan Gosling, superstar Britney Spears was also a Mouseketeer on The Mickey Mouse Club when she was younger! That moment of her career became a blip after she released her debut album in 1998, and the singer has since been dubbed "The Princess of Pop" by fans and the media alike.</p><p>Britney's released nine studio albums and has&nbsp;sold&nbsp;150 million albums worldwide. Though Britney has gone through some scandals and tough times in the public eye, her music career has continued to thrive. Britney's four-year Vegas residency was one of the highest-grossing residencies of all-time, and she's broken multiple Guinness World Records.</p><h2 id=justin-timberlake---230-million>Justin Timberlake - $230 million</h2><p>Singer Justin Timberlake was on The Mickey Mouse Club alongside Britney (who he had a highly-publicized relationship with for a few years!) It wasn't long after his stint with Disney that he joined the singing group NSYNC, which became&nbsp;one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. After NSYNC made him a star, Justin decided to venture into a solo singing career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Five studio albums later, and Justin is one of the biggest names in the&nbsp;music scene. He also developed a significant acting career, starring in movies like The Social Network, Bad Teacher, Friends With Benefits, and In Time. With all of his awards - including a whopping 10 Grammy's - it makes sense why this ex-Disney star's net worth tops the list!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>15 Former Big-Time Disney TV Stars Everyone Forgot About</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nop6wqbHSrWSesF2ZtrS6xLJkrKyRp8Bw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frichest-ex-disney-stars.html&text=10%20Richest%20Ex-Disney%20Stars&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frichest-ex-disney-stars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frichest-ex-disney-stars.html&title=10%20Richest%20Ex-Disney%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frichest-ex-disney-stars.html&title=10%20Richest%20Ex-Disney%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frichest-ex-disney-stars.html&title=10%20Richest%20Ex-Disney%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frichest-ex-disney-stars.html&description=10%20Richest%20Ex-Disney%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./expensive-things-tracy-morgan-bought.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Ridiculously Expensive Things Tracy Morgan Has Bought">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-hollywood-wives-with-strict-rules-and-10-who-are-super-chill.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Hollywood Wives With Strict Rules (And 10 Who Are Super Chill)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
