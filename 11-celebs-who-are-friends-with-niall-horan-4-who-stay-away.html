He is getting ready to release his second solo studio album, "Heartbreak Weather," on March 13th. This record will include the singles, "Nice to Meet Ya," "Put A Little Love On Me," and "No Judgment."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He is friends with many famous people and talks about them a lot on his social media pages. He met some of them through friends. A few, he met on his own. Horan is pretty friendly to everyone, but there are some people that he just can't get through life without.</p><p>Horan is not someone who has a lot of enemies - he isn't one to cause drama, but there are some people he doesn't talk to. Mostly because they are exes or because they started feuds with him.</p><p>Read on to find out who&nbsp;Niall Horan's friends are and who he doesn't talk to.</p><h2 id=friends---lewis-capaldi><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Friends - Lewis Capaldi</span></h2><p>This is a friendship that everyone wishes they had. These two seem more like brothers than they do friends. Lewis and Niall are always going to pubs together and hanging out. The duo is joining forces for the North American leg of Horan's 'Nice to Meet Ya' World Tour. Surprisingly, they met through social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends---shawn-mendes><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Friends - Shawn Mendes</span></h2><p>Horan and Mendes met backstage at an award show and have been best friends ever since. Many fans want them to collaborate, and they said they will eventually, but everyone is still waiting. Horan really loves Mendes' music and he has said that he sees him as a little brother. They constantly bounce ideas off each other.</p><h2 id=friends-harry-styles><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Friends-Harry Styles</span></h2><p>Since their 1D days, the ex-bandmates have always had each other's backs. Styles released his second solo album, "Fine Line," in December and Horan highly praised it. The pair is still up to their usual shenanigans and hang out occasionally. Styles and Horan support each other in their careers and personal lives.</p><h2 id=friends-selena-gomez><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Friends-Selena Gomez</span></h2><p>After seeing photos of the two out together in the past, fans thought they may have dated at one point. However, that is not true and they are just good friends. The "Lose You to Love Me" singer supported Horan when his single, "Nice to Meet Ya", came out. She posted on Instagram about it. They have the same friends group and hang out a lot, but they've denied all romance rumors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sorry, Fans! Looks Like Selena Gomez And Niall Horan Are NOT a 'Thing!'&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2 id=friends---louis-tomlinson><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Friends - Louis Tomlinson</span></h2><p>Tomlinson and Horan were close friends while they were in One Direction and they are still close friends. When Tomlinson released his debut solo album, "Walls," earlier this year. Horan told Twitter to 'get it climbing up the charts.' The pair also hung out backstage at Premios Telehit in Mexico and performed "Little Black Dress" together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Louis Tomlinson Talks About His Album And a One Direction Reunion... But His Grief is Off-Limits</a></span></p><h2 id=friends---fletcher><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Friends - Fletcher</span></h2><p>Along with Capaldi, this pair will also hit the road on Horan's tour. Recently, Fletcher and Horan recorded a cover of Taylor Swift's, "Lover", and it will give you chills. It even got Swift's approval. Hopefully, the singers will record more songs together because this is what the world needs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends---liam-payne><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Friends - Liam Payne</span></h2><p>Although they don't talk often, the former bandmates are still friends. They did meet up together backstage at the ZPL Birthday Bash in 2017. They are both busy. Payne just released his debut solo album and is raising his son, Bear. Horan is gearing up for his next album and tour.</p><h2 id=friends---taylor-swift><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Friends - Taylor Swift</span></h2><p>Horan is a huge fan of Swift's music and he lets everyone know it. He has said many times that his favorite Swift song is, "All Too Well," so he's a BIG fan.&nbsp; They performed "Slow Hands" together&nbsp;when Swift brought Horan out on stage for a show during her Reputation stadium tour. Hopefully, a collaboration from them will drop at some point.</p><h2 id=friends---julia-michaels><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Friends - Julia Michaels</span></h2><p>After meeting at the iHeartRadio MuchMusic Video Awards, the friends collaborated on the song, "What A Time." Michaels was the opening act during the European leg of Horan's Flicker World Tour, so they have spent a lot of time together. They had to get out of an escape room together on&nbsp;The Late Late Show With James Corden.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends---james-corden><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Friends - James Corden</span></h2><p>Like the other One Direction boys, Horan is close to the talk show host. To promote his album, Horan, like many in the past, will spend a week's residency on The Late Late Show, where he will do Carpool Karaoke and skits, and give a live performance. Corden has a special place in his heart for the 1D boys.</p><h2 id=friends---rory-mcilroy><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Friends - Rory McIlroy</span></h2><p>There are fans of golf and then there's Niall Horan. He posts at least one story on Instagram when he's playing golf. Horan caddied for McIlroy, a professional golfer, at the Masters Par 3 Contest - they have become great friends since then. Now, if Horan joined McIlroy for a game, we might tune into golf.</p><h2 id=stays-away---zayn-malik><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Stays Away&nbsp;- Zayn Malik</span></h2><p>After Malik left the band, Horan and the other 1D members did not really talk to him and they still don't. Although he has no bad blood with Malik, Horan just doesn't keep in touch with him. He is "doing his own thing", Horan has said of Zayn. Horan fears that if there is a One Direction reunion, Malik will not join.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stays-away---hailee-steinfeld><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Stays Away - Hailee Steinfeld</span></h2><p>Steinfeld and Horan dated for a few months and then broke up. They kept their relationship and breakup pretty private. However, Steinfeld released a song called "Wrong Direction," which is thought to be about Horan. Fans are speculating that a lot of songs on his upcoming album will be about Steinfeld.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hailee Steinfeld Reps New Bangs And a Diss Track For Ex Niall Horan!</a></span></p><h2 id=stays-away---ed-sheeran><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Stays Away - Ed Sheeran</span></h2><p>Apparently Ed Sheeran and Ellie Goulding were a 'thing' and then Horan stole Goulding away from Sheeran. Goulding claimed that she and Sheeran were not dating, but Sheeran said that friends don't hold hands. Sheeran supposedly penned his hit, "Don't", about the two. Sheeran has admitted to forgiving Horan.</p><h2 id=stays-away---donald-trump><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Stays Away - Donald Trump</span></h2><p>President Trump threatened to punish One Direction after they refused to take a picture with his lawyer's daughter. They were not allowed inside the garage of a Trump hotel because they refused the picture. Horan has spoken up about not being a big fan of Trump. Luckily, Horan is Irish and has a different leader running his own country.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Niall Horan Says One Direction Will Reunite...Eventually</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoamWTmrmmrtJmrqGnXZa%2FpnnFq6CeppSoeri106Fkp6GRoblutM6rmKdlZGLEqbuMrKuasV2WxKLFjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f11-celebs-who-are-friends-with-niall-horan-4-who-stay-away.html&text=11%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Friends%20With%20Niall%20Horan%20%284%20Who%20Stay%20Away%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f11-celebs-who-are-friends-with-niall-horan-4-who-stay-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f11-celebs-who-are-friends-with-niall-horan-4-who-stay-away.html&title=11%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Friends%20With%20Niall%20Horan%20%284%20Who%20Stay%20Away%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f11-celebs-who-are-friends-with-niall-horan-4-who-stay-away.html&title=11%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Friends%20With%20Niall%20Horan%20%284%20Who%20Stay%20Away%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f11-celebs-who-are-friends-with-niall-horan-4-who-stay-away.html&title=11%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Friends%20With%20Niall%20Horan%20%284%20Who%20Stay%20Away%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f11-celebs-who-are-friends-with-niall-horan-4-who-stay-away.html&description=11%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Friends%20With%20Niall%20Horan%20%284%20Who%20Stay%20Away%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-celebrity-publicity-stunts-we-all-saw-right-through.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Celebrity Publicity Stunts We All Saw Right Through">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pj-cool-tomasi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-42349-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=" Pj Cool Tomasi">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
