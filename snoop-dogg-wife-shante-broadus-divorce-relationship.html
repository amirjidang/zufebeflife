They can be <a href=#>referred to as relationship goals</a> and regarded as a couple to admire because they've been together so long, but are they a couple fans should admire?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As with any longtime couple, they've had their ups and downs.</p><p>Unfortunately, these highs and lows have been documented in the media for all to know and what is known isn't exactly pretty, even if it's not widely publicized.</p><p>Snoop Dogg's real name is Calvin Broadus Jr. and he was born in Long Beach, California.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="The Truth Behind Snoop Dogg's Claim That He's Friends With Prince William And Prince Harry">The Truth Behind Snoop Dogg's Claim That He's Friends With Prince William And Prince Harry</a></span></p><p>He was just a teenager when he met Shante Taylor in high school where they entered a teen romance going to school dances, writing love notes, and meeting each other's parents.</p><p>Snoop's rap career took off in 1993, before he and Shante married.</p><p>Then, their oldest son was born in 1994, and they had two more children together.</p><p>Snoop and his wife are married today, but it hasn't been an easy journey, and it might not be #couplegoals after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shante-remained-loyal-and-committed>Shante Remained Loyal And Committed</h2><p>Before Snoop and Shante started a family together, the early '90s rap scene was dangerous. East Coast versus West Coast rap was a real rivalry that got violent.</p><p>Snoop was involved in this gangster rap scene and what he got involved in would be enough to scare any woman away. He made some bad choices and got caught up.</p><p>2022 will mark 25 years of marriage for Snoop and his lady, but they haven't been together consistently all this time. Honestly, they probably aren't relationship goals based on all they've been through, and all Snoop has put his wife through.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First, Snoop was arrested and <a href=#>charged with first-degree murder</a> in 1993. Snoop's bodyguard shot and killed a member of a rival gang and both were arrested.</p><p>Simultaneously his album Doggystyle was a commercial hit. He was acquitted in 1996, and Shante stuck by him and still married him. It was this event that made Snoop want to end his more dangerous life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Snoop Dogg's Kids</a></span></p><p>However, he found other ways to be destructive. In their marriage, there were rumors that Snoop had cheated on Shante. Proof of that appeared after Snoop fathered another child outside their marriage; a son by another woman was born in 1998.</p><p>For reference, Snoop and Shante's second child was born in 1997 and their third child together was born in 1999. They still remained together after the drama, though.</p><h2 id=they-separated-for-a-few-years>They Separated For A Few Years</h2><p>Snoop and Shante remained married and together <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">until 2004 when Snoop filed for divorce</a>. The reason he filed may raise some eyebrows but he was apparently following a childhood dream of his.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's a questionable career and one that Snoop left the family for by choice.</p><p>Snoop has stated that he filed for divorce from his wife in order to be a pimp.</p><p>Apparently, since he was in high school, Snoop Dogg fantasized about being a pimp and decided to become one. He had his own pimp rules that his girls got their money upfront and never looked another pimp in the eyes.</p><p>At first, Shante ignored what was happening. But as it continued, they separated. However, Snoop was encouraged to return to his wife by other pimps.</p><p>He and Shante eventually reconciled and apparently called off their divorce.</p><p>The couple even <a href=#>renewed their vows and remarried in 2008</a>. Marriage goals?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=snoop-39-s-cleaned-up-image>Snoop's Cleaned Up Image</h2><p>These days Snoop Dogg has quite the family image now. He does voices in kid's cartoon movies and is a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">well-known animal lover</a>. Snoop and Shante are grandparents now too.</p><p><a href=#>Snoop has also developed a friendship with Martha Stewart</a> that has helped clean up his social standing.</p><p>Fun fact: Martha Stewart has actually served time in prison, but Snoop hasn't, and the rapper is fond of joking about this with his domestic BFF.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Snoop Dogg Has This Surprisingly Wholesome Gig On His Resume</a></span></p><p>Snoop and Shante are still together now and have proved a commitment to each other. Shante is now Snoop's manager and has a lot of control over his image, products, and events he does. Snoop awarded Shante that position after all her years of loyal love and support.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Snoop <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even admits he put his wife "through a lot"</a> and through it all, she remained "rock solid." That is true love for some and a stressful marriage for others. At the end of the day, only Snoop and Shante know the details of their marriage and relationship.</p><p>Is it a relationship and marriage to admire? It depends on what fans consider healthy and successful, but Snoop and his wife still being together today suggests that what they have going works for them.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Snoop Dogg Shows Off His Grandson's Dance Moves</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqp6efpXqlu8agZLChlpp6tLTAp6ueZZKnvKKw1KxknaGmpL%2BksYyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsnoop-dogg-wife-shante-broadus-divorce-relationship.html&text=Is%20Snoop%20Dogg%27s%20Marriage%20To%20His%20Wife%20Really%20Something%20To%20Admire%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsnoop-dogg-wife-shante-broadus-divorce-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsnoop-dogg-wife-shante-broadus-divorce-relationship.html&title=Is%20Snoop%20Dogg%27s%20Marriage%20To%20His%20Wife%20Really%20Something%20To%20Admire%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsnoop-dogg-wife-shante-broadus-divorce-relationship.html&title=Is%20Snoop%20Dogg%27s%20Marriage%20To%20His%20Wife%20Really%20Something%20To%20Admire%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsnoop-dogg-wife-shante-broadus-divorce-relationship.html&title=Is%20Snoop%20Dogg%27s%20Marriage%20To%20His%20Wife%20Really%20Something%20To%20Admire%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsnoop-dogg-wife-shante-broadus-divorce-relationship.html&description=Is%20Snoop%20Dogg%27s%20Marriage%20To%20His%20Wife%20Really%20Something%20To%20Admire%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jason-nash-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jason Nash Net Worth  How Much is Nash Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-awra-briguela-dating-anyone-relationship-and-dating-history-662231-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Awra Briguela Dating Anyone?
