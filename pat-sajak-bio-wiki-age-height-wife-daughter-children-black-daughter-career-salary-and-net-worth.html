In 1977, Sajak moved to KNBC-TV in Los Angeles to be a full-time weatherman for the station.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pat-sajak-vanna-white-wheel-of-fortune></span><span id=Pat_Sajak_Vanna_White_Wheel_Of_Fortune>Pat Sajak Vanna White Wheel Of Fortune</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wheel of Fortune originally aired as a daytime series on NBC from January 6, 1975, to June 30, 1989.&nbsp;After some changes were made to its format, the daytime series from July 17, 1989, to January 11, 1991, moved to CBS.</p><p>In 1981, Sajak was asked by Merv Griffin if he would be interested in taking over the duties as a host on Wheel of Fortune from Chuck Woolery.</p><p>However, Fred Silverman, who was the president and CEO of NBC at the time, rejected Sajak’s hiring, claiming he was too local. Griffin responded by imposing a moratorium on new tapings until Sajak was hired.</p><p>From 1983 to 1989, Sajak hosted both the daytime (NBC) and syndicated evening versions of Wheel of Fortune. He continues to host Wheel of Fortune to date.</p><p>With him returning for his 36th season in 2018–19, Sajak became the longest-running host of any game show.

The show’s primary formation has not changed since Vanna White spun her first letter in 1982: Participants spin a large carnival-style wheel for a possibility to solve word puzzles for cash and prizes.</p><p>In 1997, the board advanced to digital, and White’s job shifted from turning letters to just tapping them awake. The “Wheel of Fortune” has grown a little more complex over the years, with mini-games inside the game, including “crossword rounds” (intertwined words joined by a clue) and “triple toss-ups” (one round with three quick puzzles).</p><p>Vanna White had to handle all of those on top of balancing the host’s core duties of maintaining the fast-paced game moving along and paying close observation in case contestants incorrectly made a word plural or added a word to a phrase. These were duties that White, who had only one dusty run before filming, “subconsciously understood but had to be very aware of.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pat-sajak-rugrats></span><span id=Pat_Sajak_Rugrats>Pat Sajak Rugrats</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On Rugrats, Pat is the spokesman for a Publishers Clearing House-like multi-million dollar sweepstakes that Chas wins in the episode Chuckie is Rich, and Chas’ reaction is exactly what would happen if he was a contestant on Wheel.
