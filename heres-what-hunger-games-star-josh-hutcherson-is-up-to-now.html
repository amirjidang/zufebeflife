An extremely successful series at the box office, at the height of the Hunger Games movie’s popularity, there were legions of devoted fans who showed up in droves to see them. While a lot of fans still love those films, it is surprising to see how many people seem to have completely forgotten about them considering how huge they once were.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the heyday of the Hunger Games’ popularity, it certainly seemed like Josh Hutcherson was set to become a pretty big star. After all, it could be argued that Hutcherson was the Hunger Games franchise’s second most important star, given that Jennifer Lawrence obviously headlined those films.</p><p>Despite the fact that he was such a big deal, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there is a lot that many of Josh Hutcherson's former fans don't know about him</a>, including what he's been doing recently. With that in mind, the obvious question is this, what has Hutcherson been up to since he left the Hunger Games movies behind?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprisingly Deep Messages Buried In ‘The Hunger Games’ Series</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=career-beginnings>Career Beginnings</h2><p>A former child star, Josh Hutcherson’s acting career began when he started to appear in various TV commercials the same year he turned 10-years-old. Despite the fact that some actors wait years to find their big break, within months Hutcherson landed his first lead role when he was cast in a pilot that didn’t go to series in 2002. After moving on to a small role in an episode of ER, he starred in his first film, a TV movie called Miracle Dogs that was released by Animal Planet.</p><p>Continuing to land small roles in notable shows and movies or big parts in films and series that went nowhere, Josh Hutcherson's career went to a whole new level in 2005. Chosen to play the main character in Jon Favreau’s Jumanji sequel Zathura: A Space Adventure, the movie underwhelmed at the box office but proved that Hutcherson could carry a film.</p><p>From that point on in his career, Josh Hutcherson went on to play one of the main characters in several films in a row. For example, he went on to star in movies like RV, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant, The Kids Are All Right, and Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of all that success, it could easily be argued that the biggest thing to happen early on in Josh Hutcherson’s career was the moment he was cast as the lead in Bridge to Terabithia. After all, people may not talk about that movie all that much now but it was a Disney fantasy film and it made a big profit based on its production budget.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liam Hemsworth’s 10 Closest Celebrity Friends</a></span></p><h2 id=his-biggest-role-to-date>His Biggest Role To Date</h2><p>Even though Josh Hutcherson has accomplished an awful lot, there is little doubt that to date starring in the Hunger Games franchise represents the peak of his career. After all, Hutcherson was chosen to play one of the main characters in a huge franchise when loads of young actors wanted to be in his shoes. On top of that, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a lot of interesting things went on behind-the-scenes of the Hunger Games movies</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cast as Peeta Mellark, one of the two men who were competing for the heart of Katniss Everdeen, it could be argued that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Hutcherson was part of cinema's best love triangles</a>. Thankfully for him, and the Hunger Games franchise as a whole, Hutcherson was able to hold his own with Lawrence on screen. That is pretty impressive since Lawrence was such a big star and so respected at that time. It also was extremely important that the two actors shared chemistry and they certainly did.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Little Known Facts About Jennifer Lawrence’s Rise To Fame</a></span></p><h2 id=leaving-the-hunger-games-behind>Leaving The Hunger Games Behind</h2><p>Ever since the release of 2015’s The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2, Josh Hutcherson has left the role that he still is most famous for behind. That said, if you are under the impression that his sole career highlight is playing Peeta Mellark on the big screen then you are sorely mistaken.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same year the last Hunger Games movie came out, Hutcherson’s movie Escobar: Paradise Lost was released. While that film failed to find a huge audience, it was a big deal for him as he produced it. In yet another example of him taking his career in new directions, in recent years <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Hutcherson has directed a short film and a pair of music videos</a> for Foster the People and West Coast Massive. While away from the cameras entirely, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Hutcherson has worked with the gay-straight alliance as a part of their “Straight But Not Narrow" chapter</a>.</p><p>Continue to act in recent years, Josh Hutcherson’s main film credits include The Disaster Artist, Tragedy Girls, and Burn. However, his greatest successes as of late have been as a part of ongoing series. After all, he lent his voice to 13 episodes of the English version of Ultraman and he starred in the Hulu original series Future Man which ended after its 3rd season was released.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hunger Games Is Getting A Prequel Movie!
