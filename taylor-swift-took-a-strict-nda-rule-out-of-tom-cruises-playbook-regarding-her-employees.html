Nonetheless, both have certain rules in common. Your Tango listed some of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor's strict rules employees have to follow</a>.</p><p>Among the list included employees have to sign an NDA, so that they don't leak any info about what goes on behind the scenes. In 2014, Swift had journalists sign an NDA after listening to 1989 prior to its release.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-wearing-black-onstage.jpg><p>Your Tango also mentions that celebs making employees sign NDAs really isn't anything new.</p><p>The publication writes, "Rumor has it that all of Swift’s intimate partners must sign a non-disclosure agreement. It’s no surprise that she holds her employees to the same standards. It’s common practice for companies to require NDAs from all of their employees."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Swift is no different and is smart for making them sign on the dotted line.

In fact, <a href=#>Cruise even made the nannies sign an NDA</a>. Celebrity nanny Suzanne Hansen revealed, “Tom would make his nannies sign confidentiality agreements that were so strict, they couldn’t even say for whom they were working. So basically, if (Cruise) went on camera and said how he didn’t have any help raising his children, they couldn’t say anything.”</p><p>Tom has also been very private about his personal life, so this should not come as a surprise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-don-39-t-believe-a-certain-taylor-swift-rule-that-alleges-she-forces-her-celeb-friends-to-attend-her-shows>Fans Don't Believe A Certain Taylor Swift Rule That Alleges She Forces Her Celeb Friends To Attend Her Shows</h2><p>Fans don't agree with all of Taylor Swift's rules. In fact, fans don't believe that Taylor Swift enforces a certain rule to begin with. It was said that Swift forces her celebrity friends to attend concerts as a way to get more exposure. Given Swift's insane popularity and success, this one is very hard to believe. It is likely that friends of Taylor's likely take part to experience her shows and, if anything, they themselves might want the exposure of appearing at a Taylor Swift show.</p><p><a href=#>Fans completely disagreed with the rule</a>.

Matt Damon retold the story of a coordinator questioning a certain stunt Cruise had planned. Disagreeing with Tom wasn't the best idea.</p><p>Damon revealed, "I remember I had dinner with him once, and it was after he did the [Mission: Impossible movie] where he ran around the building. And I go, ‘Can you tell me how that happened?’ And he’s a really intense guy, and he was like, ‘I’ll tell you how it happened!’ I go, ‘Alright.’ And I’m in."</p><p>"He goes, ‘I’ve been thinking about this shot for 15 years!’ And I’m like, ‘Wow, really?’ He goes, ‘So I go to the safety guy, and I lay it all out.’ Safety guy goes, ‘We can’t do that. It’s too dangerous, you can’t do that.
