She was only 18 when she tied the knot with Conrad "Nicky" Hilton Jr., the heir of the Hilton hotelier dynasty. The marriage ended up in divorce eight months later after she endured abuse at the hands of Hilton.From 1952 to 1957, Taylor was married to British actor Micheal Wilding, who was 20 years her senior. In 1957, the star married film and theater producer Mike Todd, but their relationship was cut short due to his tragic death in a plane crash the following year. Soon afterwards, Taylor began an affair with Todd's and her friend, actor and singer Eddie Fisher, who was married to actress Debbie Reynolds at the time. He and Taylor wed in 1959.One the set of Cleopatra in 1961, Taylor and the love of her life Richard Burton began their heavily publicized affair while they were both married to other people. They famously became husband and wife twice: a first time in 1964, divorcing in 1974, and a second time in 1975, calling it quits in 1976. Taylor then married Republican politician John Warner in 1976 and construction worker Larry Fortensky in 1988.Despite having an intense personal life, admittedly due to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a certain puritanical upbringing</a> that led her to believe that love was strictly connected to marriage, not all of Taylor's multiple romances and affairs resulted in a stroll down the aisle. Let's have a look at the short-lived love stories and rumored relationships the actress had in between her eight marriages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elizabeth-taylor-briefly-dated-football-player-glenn-davis><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Elizabeth Taylor Briefly Dated Football Player Glenn Davis</span></h2><p>Eager to gain some independence from both her family and the studio that had her under contract, MGM, Taylor was not opposed to tying the knot early.</p><p>When she was 16 in 1948, the actress was set up by MGM on a date with football player Glenn Davis, eight years older than her. Back then, it was customary for the studios to arrange dates between their most prominent stars and other actors or public figures to maximize publicity around new releases.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Natalie Wood Was Married To The Same Man Twice Because They Simply Couldn't "Understand" Each Other</a></span></p><p>However, Taylor and Davis only dated briefly and never publicly discussed marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=at-17-elizabeth-taylor-got-engaged-to-william-pawley-jr><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>At 17, Elizabeth Taylor Got Engaged To William Pawley Jr.</span></h2><p>In 1949, a 17-year-old Taylor got engaged to US army pilot William Pawley Jr., who was the son of US ambassador William D. Pawley.</p><p>Once again, the relationship was very short. Taylor never said "I do" to Pawley Jr., who was 28 when he proposed. According to sources, Taylor wanted to continue pursuing her acting dreams in Hollywood rather than settle down, a decision which ultimately caused them to split.</p><p>While she married Hilton the following year, the brief romance she shared with Pawley Jr. must've left a lasting impression on the latter. The pilot only got married 25 years after he and Taylor called off the engagement and broke up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=howard-hughes-offered-elizabeth-taylor-s-family-a-ton-of-money-to-marry-her><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Howard Hughes Offered Elizabeth Taylor's Family A Ton Of Money To Marry Her</span></h2><p>In a move that would raise concerns and eyebrows today, film tycoon Howard Hughes attempted to strike a deal with Taylor's family, offering them money to marry the actress.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Elizabeth Taylor's Diamond Ring</a></span></p><p>27 years her senior, Hughes was ready to pay Taylor's parents a whopping six-figure sum to make her his wife, but the star-in-the-making, who was 16 or 17 at the time, declined the offer.</p><h2 id=general-hospital-actor-anthony-geary-became-elizabeth-taylor-s-boy-toy><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>General Hospital Actor Anthony Geary Became Elizabeth Taylor's "Boy Toy"</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor separated from Republican John Warner in 1981, with their divorce finalized the following year.</p><p>Shortly after they ended their relationship, Taylor embarked on another romance, this time to actor Anthony Geary, who is 15 years younger than her.</p><p>They met in 1981, when Taylor guest starred as villain Helena Cassadine in <a href=#>ABC's long-running daytime soap General Hospital</a>, where Geary portrayed the role of Luke Spencer.</p><p>"I used to never talk about my relationship with Elizabeth Taylor because I'm a gentleman and don't kiss and tell, but she did an interview a few years ago for Talk Magazine where she outed us as more than friends. Yeah, so I don't mind telling that. I was sort of her boy toy for a couple of years," Geary confirmed on The Wendy Williams Show in 2010.</p><h2 id=elizabeth-taylor-and-victor-luna-got-engaged-in-1983><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Elizabeth Taylor And Victor Luna Got Engaged In 1983</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It isn't clear how long Taylor's relationship with Geary lasted, though the two must've parted ways some time in 1982 or early 1983, right before Taylor got engaged again.</p><p>The actress and Mexican lawyer Victor Luna were supposed to tie the knot, but never made it to the altar.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Where Are Elizabeth Taylor's Kids (And Grandkids) Today?</a></span></p><p>In 1984, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actress called off the engagement</a> and returned the 16-carat sapphire ring he had presented her with the previous year.</p><h2 id=elizabeth-taylor-and-dennis-stein-were-engaged-for-two-months><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Elizabeth Taylor And Dennis Stein Were Engaged For Two Months</span></h2><p>Four years before marrying her last husband, Larry Fortensky, Taylor got engaged to businessman Dennis Stein, after two months of courtship on his part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1984, she accepted Stein's marriage proposal, accompanied by a sapphire and diamond engagement ring.
