Unsurprisingly, Brady has made numerous media headlines about his career and personal life. But no headline sent more shock waves than his divorce from Brazilian supermodel <strong><a href=#>Giselle </a></strong><a href=#>Bündchen</a>. Shortly after the commotion died down from their split, the media and fans speculated on who Tom Brady would date next. That lucky woman seemed to be Russian model Irina Shayk.</p><p>It's long been evident that Tom Brady prefers the romantic company of high-profile women, as Bündchen and Shayk are not the only women he's dated. For instance, Brady shares a son with actress Bridget Moynahan. As for Brady's alleged girlfriend, Irina Shayk, the model once dated actor Bradley Cooper, with whom they share a daughter, Lea De Sein.
