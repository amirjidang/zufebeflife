Christine was Kody’s third wife and their love story played out on their family’s famous reality series on TLC. Christine remained in her plural family for 25 years, welcoming six children with Kody. However, she decided it was time to say goodbye to that chapter of her life in 2021.</p><p><a href=#>The TV star had quite a transformation</a> after ending her spiritual marriage. Following their messy split,<strong> Christine found love again</strong>, and it was <strong>nothing like her polygamous marriage to Kody</strong>. The mom-of-six did not opt for a spiritual marriage; neither was she the third wife.

The former “Sister Wives” star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">announced that she was back in the dating game </a>in early 2023 with a post on social media where she wrote:</p><p>“I’m dating again!! Holy. Hell. Awkward. Dating online is crazy!... Any advice for dating at 50?!”</p><p>Less than a month after the post, <strong>Christine went public about her relationship with David,</strong> and it was clear that she was totally smitten by him. She gushed about her new lover on social media, explaining how happy she had been since meeting David. On Valentine’s Day in 2023, Christine took to social media to gush about David with a series of images featuring both of them and a caption:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screen-shot-2023-01-31-at-9-19-15-am.png><p>“I finally found the love of my life, David. The first time he held me close, it felt like my soul took its first breath. He’s wonderful and kind, incredible with my children, and an adorable grandpa. I never dreamed I could find a love like this.”</p><p>Their love story took a rather swift turn as they met each other's families. David has eight children from his previous marriage. Christine also shares children Aspyn, Mykelti, Paedon, Gwendlyn, Ysabel, and Truely with her ex-husband Kody. Christine’s children lived in different parts of the United States, but this was not a challenge for David as he made sure he met all of them. He also met some of her fellow Sister Wives stars' children and grandchildren. <a href=#>Fans were shocked by Kody Brown's reaction to David</a> after they met.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/christine-brown-looking-surprised.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Everything We Know About Sister Wives' Christine Brown's Pricey New Home">Everything We Know About Sister Wives' Christine Brown's Pricey New Home</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Christine Brown might not be one of the Sister Wives anymore, but her new house is nothing to scoff at.</p><p>Two months after Christine went public about her new relationship, the reality TV star revealed she and David were on the next level. Christine shared her joy on social media on April 13, 2023, with photos of her and David as she explained that they got engaged. In the post, Christine noted that David had popped the question in a very romantic way. David also shared his excitement, noting that he was the luckiest man and Christine was the most caring person he had ever met.</p><p>A few months after their engagement, the lovebirds tied the knot on October 7, 2023. Christine had her dream wedding in Moab, Utah, in front of 330 guests. The Sister Wives alum revealed to People exclusively that the ceremony was everything she thought she couldn’t have.

David, who is both a parent and grandparent like Christine, opened up about his occupation in a July 2023 post on his social media.

Before their breakup, Christine revealed that she and Kody grew apart before they eventually called it quits.

It is no secret that <strong>Christine and Kody grew apart gradually</strong> as some of the drama that caused their estrangement played out on TLC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sister-wives-1.jpg><p>During the coronavirus outbreak, Kody restrained movements in his home, which kept the large family apart. He revealed in a Thanksgiving episode of Sister Wives in 2021 that Covid kept a strain on his family. However, Christine found Kody’s decision hypocritical, and she questioned him in another episode, noting that Kody allowed Robyn’s nanny in the home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an episode of the TLC family reality series, Christine also shared the surprises she discovered during a therapy program with Kody.

Christine and the other sister wives were not close to Robyn, and Kody was not pleased with this.

He also claimed she was a game player.</p><p>Kody later admitted the role he played in their failed marriage. According to the Sister Wives star, he had wanted to break his marriage with Christine before she initiated their split.
