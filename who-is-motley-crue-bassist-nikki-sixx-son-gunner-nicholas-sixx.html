He may have millions of fans around the world, but he is also a father, a role he seems to take very seriously. Nikki is a dad to five children, only two of which are sons, and his oldest is Gunner Nicholas Sixx.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gunnar was born on Jan. 25, 1991, and is a fascinating and talented individual carving out his own path (although not that much is truly known about him). But he does have some similarities with his famous dad, including a shared love of music. So, who is Gunnar Sixx, the son of one of the world's most legendary rockers, and what do you need to know about him? We are going to find out.</p><h2 id=gunnar-sixx-is-one-of-nikki-sixx-39-s-five-children><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Gunnar Sixx Is One Of Nikki Sixx's Five Children</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nikki-sixx-and-courtney-sixx.jpg><p>Nikki Sixx may be a father of five, but he shares his first three children with his ex-wife, Brandi Brandt. In addition to his son, Gunner Nicholas Sixx, who is the oldest, the couple also has a second son, Decker, and a daughter, Storm (this means Gunnar has two full siblings and two step-siblings). Nikki also has an adult daughter, Frankie, with Donna D'Errico (best known for her role in Baywatch and her modeling with Playboy), and a toddler, Ruby, who the <a href=# rel=nofollow>rockstar shares with his current wife</a>, Courtney Sixx.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gunnar-sixx-39-s-mother-is-brandi-brandt><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gunnar Sixx's Mother Is Brandi Brandt</span></h2><p>Brandi Brandt is a model and former Playboy Playmate. She was married to Nikki Sixx from 1989 to 1997 and the former couple shares three children, the oldest being Gunnar. In 2014, Brandt made headlines for her legal issues as she found herself embroiled in a substance smuggling scandal that saw her face up to six years in prison. According to CBC, she had pleaded guilty "to a charge of conspiring to import drugs."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Did Tommy Lee Suffer From Postpartum Depression After Pamela Anderson Became A Mom?</a></span></p><p>Her defense attorney Phillip Boulten had asked the court for leniency regarding the matter, bringing up Brandt's "pretty mixed-up childhood."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gunnar-sixx-is-a-musician-like-his-father><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Gunnar Sixx Is A Musician Like His Father</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nikki-sixx-2.jpg><p>Gunnar Sixx is also a musician and this is something that his famous father is very proud of.

As you know I am always looking for new music not only for my ears but also for other people as well. I have been very open about creativity and supporting music over the years in my books and blogs. As a father, you hope to pass this on to your kids.

In addition to being a passionate musician, Gunnar Sixx has also shared photos of artwork, which we can only assume is his because you can message him to ask for pricing.</p><p>He accompanies the photos with a caption about the materials used to create each piece, for example, acrylic and charcoal on canvas. He also shares a glimpse into the inspiration for each design. For this particular image, he wrote, "Hey yeah it's my birthday and I just finished this painting. I am surrounded by the sweetest creatures on the planet and I wake up every day excited to be where I am in my life. I hope this painting captures that appreciation and love."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gunnar-sixx-gave-nikki-sixx-the-best-job-of-his-life><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Gunnar Sixx Gave Nikki Sixx The Best Job Of His Life</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nikki-sixx.jpg><p>While we cannot pretend to know the ins and outs of Nikki Sixx's relationship with his son, Gunnar, what we do know is what he has said publicly. That is how much fatherhood means to him. "I didn't have a father, and I always loved being a father," he said, according to USA Today. "It's an itch I can't scratch. My kids are older, and I have a great relationship with them."</p><h2 id=nikki-sixx-39-s-children-have-taught-him-so-much><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Nikki Sixx's Children Have Taught Him So Much</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nikki-sixx-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nikki Sixx has been vocal about the challenges in his childhood. His father left when he was three and his mother left when he was six. In an interview, he explained how she rang up his grandparents to come and get him. When he has discussed his own family, things are much happier. According to The Guardian, in a 2015 interview, <a href=# rel=nofollow>before the birth of his fifth child (daughter, Ruby)</a> he had this to say about his kids: "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">I have four amazing children</a>, and it's been the greatest thing that’s ever happened in my life.

Some people will argue that you can find out a lot about someone by seeing how they treat animals. There is even a quote believed to be attributed to <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Beatles rock star</a> Paul McCartney that states "You can judge a man's true character by the way he treats his fellow animals."</p><h2 id=gunnar-sixx-will-always-have-the-support-of-his-dad><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Gunnar Sixx Will Always Have The Support Of His Dad</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What Gunnar Sixx has or has not done with his life is his business, and we are not here to dig into it. But what we do know is that his father, Nikki Sixx, tried to impart wisdom to him and his siblings with regard to taking drugs. Nikki Sixx's wild rocker days are well-documented, so when he addressed the topic it was challenging for him to do with a "straight face."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Here's How Rich Is Vince Neil Compared To Tommy Lee And Motley Crue</a></span></p><p>He tackled the subject with respect, telling his children (via The Guardian), "'You're going to make your own decisions, and I'm going to be here to support you because I didn't have that.'
