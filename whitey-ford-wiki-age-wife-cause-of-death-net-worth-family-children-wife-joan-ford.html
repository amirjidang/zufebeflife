He played his entire 16-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the New York Yankees.&nbsp;He was a 10-time All-Star (and three-time AL starting pitcher) over 16 Major League seasons (1950, 1953–1967).</p><p>Edward Charles “Whitey” Ford was born on Oct 21, 1928, in Manhattan and moved with his family to Queens as a young child. He made his major league debut for the New York Yankees on July 1, 1950, and spent his entire career with the Bronx Bombers.</p><p>Ford is the Yankees’ all-time wins leader with a lifetime record of 236-106. Three times he paced the AL in victories (18 in 1955, 25 in 1961, 24 in 1963) and he twice led his league in ERA (2.47 in 1956, 2.01 in 1958) and shutouts (7 in 1958 and 4 in 1960). He missed two prime years of his career while serving in the Army during the 1951 and 1952 seasons.</p><p>A member of six Yankees World Series championship teams (1950, ’53, ’56, ’58, ’61-62) and 11 pennant winners, he still holds many World Series records, including those for wins (10), consecutive scoreless innings (33.0) and strikeouts (94).</p><p>In 1961, he had his signature season, anchoring the Yankees’ pitching staff on one of the most dominant teams of all-time and earning the AL Cy Young Award with a 25-4 (.862) record, 3.21 ERA and 11 complete games in 283.0 innings pitched. He also won the World Series MVP Award that year with a 2-0 record and 14.0 scoreless innings pitched in the Yankees’ 4-games-to-1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds as the starting pitcher in Games 1 and 4.</p><p>In 1974, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame alongside teammate Mickey Mantle, and his No.16 was retired at Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.</p><p>In franchise history, Ford ranks first in wins (236), innings pitched (3,170.1) and shutouts (45), tied for first in games started (438), second in strikeouts (1,958), third in winning percentage (.690, min: 100 decisions), fourth in games pitched (498), fifth in ERA (2.75) and tied for sixth in complete games (156).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whitey-ford-age></span> Whitey Ford Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whitey Ford was born on October 21, 1928, in New York City, New York. He died on October 8, 2020, in Lake Success, New York. He was 91.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whitey-ford-wife></span> Whitey Ford Wife<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whitey Ford was married to his wife Joan Ford from 1951 until his death in 2020. They married at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church in Glen Cove, New York on Long Island.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whitey-ford-children></span> Whitey Ford Children<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whitey Ford and his wife Joan Ford had three children: Eddie Ford, Thomas Ford, and Sally Ann Ford.&nbsp;Their son, Thomas, passed away in 1999.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whitey-ford-family></span> Whitey Ford Family<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whitey Ford is survived by his wife, Joan Ford, children, Sally Ann Ford and Eddi Forde, his eight grandchildren, six great-grandchildren.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whitey-ford-death></span> Whitey Ford Death<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whitey Ford died on October 8, 2020, at the age of 91 at his home in Lake Success, N.Y., surrounded by his wife of 69 years, Joan, son, Eddie, and daughter-in-law, Cathi.</p><p>Yankees Managing General Partner Hal Steinbrenner said on the passing of Whitey Ford: “Whitey’s name and accomplishments are forever stitched into the fabric of baseball’s rich history. He was a treasure, and one of the greatest of Yankees to ever wear the pinstripes. Beyond the accolades that earned him his rightful spot within the walls of the Hall of Fame, in so many ways he encapsulated the spirit of the Yankees teams he played for and represented for nearly two decades.</p><p>“Whitey was New York tough. When you couple that with his dedicated service to our country, a deep love for the only team he ever played for, six World Championships, and a genuine personality and charisma that showed throughout his life, it’s no wonder he endeared himself as a legend to generations of Yankees fans everywhere.</p><p>“While there is comfort knowing Whitey was surrounded by his family at the time of his passing while watching his favorite team compete, this is a tremendous loss to the Yankees and the baseball community. We have lost our ‘Chairman of the Board,’ and we extend our deepest condolences to the entire Ford family.”</p><p>Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement: “Today all of Major League Baseball mourns the loss of Whitey Ford, a New York City native who became a legend for his hometown team. Whitey earned his status as the ace of some of the most memorable teams in our sport’s rich history. Beyond the Chairman of the Board’s excellence on the mound, he was a distinguished ambassador for our National Pastime throughout his life. I extend my deepest condolences to Whitey’s family, his friends and admirers throughout our game, and all fans of the Yankees.”</p><p>In addition to Whitey Ford, other baseball greats who have passed away in 2020 include Al Kaline, Tom Seaver, Lou Brock, and Bob Gibson.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whitey-ford-cause-of-death></span> Whitey Ford Cause of Death<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whitey Ford’s cause of death was not revealed.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whitey-ford-net-worth></span> Whitey Ford Net Worth<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whitey Ford’s net worth was estimated to be $4 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYnsGmxYyfpqucXay2rLWMmp6eZaees6Z5wpqsrJ1dpLNusMSaq6FlnprBbsPOq6uhZZaWuqq42GaaoaGcmb%2BmuoywoJ%2BdXZ%2B8orqMn6arnF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhitey-ford-wiki-age-wife-cause-of-death-net-worth-family-children-wife-joan-ford.html&text=Whitey%20Ford%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Cause%20of%20Death%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Wife%20%28Joan%20Ford%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhitey-ford-wiki-age-wife-cause-of-death-net-worth-family-children-wife-joan-ford.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhitey-ford-wiki-age-wife-cause-of-death-net-worth-family-children-wife-joan-ford.html&title=Whitey%20Ford%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Cause%20of%20Death%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Wife%20%28Joan%20Ford%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhitey-ford-wiki-age-wife-cause-of-death-net-worth-family-children-wife-joan-ford.html&title=Whitey%20Ford%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Cause%20of%20Death%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Wife%20%28Joan%20Ford%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhitey-ford-wiki-age-wife-cause-of-death-net-worth-family-children-wife-joan-ford.html&title=Whitey%20Ford%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Cause%20of%20Death%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Wife%20%28Joan%20Ford%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhitey-ford-wiki-age-wife-cause-of-death-net-worth-family-children-wife-joan-ford.html&description=Whitey%20Ford%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Cause%20of%20Death%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family%2c%20Children%2c%20Wife%20%28Joan%20Ford%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-are-julia-garner-parents-mother-tami-gingold-and-painter-father-thomas-garner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Julia Garner Parents?
