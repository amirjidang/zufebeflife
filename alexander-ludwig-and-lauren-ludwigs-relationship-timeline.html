He played the villainous character Cato in the first Hunger Games film. Before landing the role in the blockbuster movie, he played a lead character in the film Race to Witch Mountain. Ludwig has also had roles in Grown Ups 2, The Final Girls, and Bad Boys for Life. He recently appeared in a <strong><a href=#>Nicki Minaj </a></strong>music video for the song “Super Freaky Girl.”</p><p>Ludwig played one of the lead roles in the hit television show Vikings. The show ran for six seasons from 2014 to 2020. Ludwig’s character was Bjorn Lothbrok, and he appeared in 67 episodes of the series. The actor has two upcoming projects titled Marked Men and The Covenant.</p><h2 id=when-alexander-ludwig-dated-vikings-co-star-kristy-dinsmore><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>When Alexander Ludwig Dated Vikings Co-Star Kristy Dinsmore</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans are not surprised when co-stars begin dating each other. Celebrities often meet their significant others while on set, especially when they are playing love interests. Though Kristy Dinsmore and Alexander Ludwig did not play love interests in the History Channel’s television show Vikings, they were on set together after Dinsmore joined the cast in the 5th season of the show to play the character Amma.</p><p>Ludwig and Dinsmore began dating in 2019 after they fell for each other on the set of Vikings. They shared many photos of each other, but that all stopped in January 2020. That was the last time a photo was seen of them together. They kept their breakup private, but their split happened sometime in early 2020. <a href=#>Ludwig has been linked to many other celebrities over the years</a>.</p><h2 id=who-is-lauren-dear><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Who Is Lauren Dear?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike Alexander Ludwig, Lauren Dear is not an actress. She is not an entertainer of any sort, instead working behind the scenes in marketing. Dear is a marketing campaign manager and social media manager. She has worked in Vancouver, Los Angeles, and even in Australia. She is originally from Canada.</p><p>Dear co-founded LAF Agency, which is an influencer management and marketing agency. She works with influencers, brands, and companies. She specializes in luxury items and jewelry. While Dear is certainly used to the life of celebrities since she works in influencer marketing, dating Ludwig is certainly a new experience for her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Surprising Facts About Vikings Star, Alexander Ludwig</a></span></p><h2 id=when-alexander-ludwig-and-lauren-dear-became-instagram-official><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>When Alexander Ludwig And Lauren Dear Became Instagram Official</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alexander-Ludwig-in-Vikings-via-tvguide.com_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not long after Alexander Ludwig split from Vikings co-star Kristy Dinsmore, the actor was already in a serious relationship with Lauren Dear. Typically, celebrities wait several months before announcing a new relationship to the public. This is to keep the relationship private while it is still in its early stages. When Ludwig first shared a photo of Dear in July 2020, they had likely already been dating for a while.</p><p>Ludwig and Dear share many photos of each other on social media, documentary their happy memories together and sharing their love with the world. Though they do not shy away from social media, they certainly keep some aspects of their relationship to themselves. Ludwig and Dear have not shared how or exactly when they first met. Fans assume they met through connections or through social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-alexander-ludwig-proposed-to-lauren-dear><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Alexander Ludwig Proposed To Lauren Dear</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alexander-Ludwig-in-Vikings-via-innotechtoday.com_.jpg><p>Not long after sharing their relationship with the world, Alexander Ludwig and Lauren Dear announced their engagement. In November 2020, Ludwig and Dear shared the news on social media. They had been dating for less than a year by the time of the proposal, but they already knew they were meant to be together forever.</p><p>Some fans were confused by the announcement, however, due to the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dear was wearing her engagement ring on her right hand as opposed to the typical left hand</a>. Some suggested this was due to a religious custom or preference. Regardless, friends, family, and fans were thrilled by the news and wished the happy couple the best. Following their engagement, Ludwig and Dear adopted a dog together, whom they named Yam.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-alexander-ludwig-and-lauren-dear-eloped-in-utah><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Why Alexander Ludwig And Lauren Dear Eloped In Utah</span></h2><p>Celebrity weddings can be large affairs. Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas both had multiple weddings with their partners, as did <strong><a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a></strong> and<strong><a href=#> Travis Barker</a></strong>. The costs can certainly skyrocket when planning such elaborate affairs. Other celebrities, however, choose to go in a different route with their wedding ceremonies. <a href=#>Many famous YouTubers have chosen to get married in secret</a>. These secret ceremonies not only keep costs down, but also provide a more intimate and private moment for the couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alexander Ludwig and Lauren Dear chose the second option for their wedding, and they took it a step further. Just a month after announcing their engagement, Ludwig and Dear announced that they had eloped in Utah. They were married at The Lodge at Blue Sky’s private retreat outside Salt Lake City. Due to the global pandemic, the couple knew that a large ceremony was out of the question, and they refused to wait to tie the knot. The Ludwigs celebrated later with their closest friends and family.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason ‘Vikings’ Star Alexander Ludwig Agreed To A Role In ‘Heels’</a></span></p><h2 id=lauren-ludwig-suffered-three-miscarriages><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Lauren Ludwig Suffered Three Miscarriages</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following their weddings in early January 2021, Alexander and Lauren Ludwig wanted to start a family.
