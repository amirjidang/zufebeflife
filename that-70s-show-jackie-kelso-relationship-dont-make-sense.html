They were not meant to be like Pam Beesly and Jim Halpert were from The Office. They were not always the most adorable couple to see like Leonard and Penny from Big Bang Theory&nbsp;either.

The coolest thing about their onscreen relationship is that it led them to have a relationship in real life. Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher are now married with children which is pretty amazing if you ask us. It isn't every day that celebrities meet on the set of the movies and TV shows they are filming and end up falling in love forever!</p><h2 id=jackie-seemed-to-only-have-fallen-for-kelso-based-on-his-looks><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Jackie Seemed To Only Have Fallen For Kelso Based On His Looks</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/70s3.jpg><p class=p1>The relationship between Jackie and Kelso always seemed to be very shallow. When they first started dating, it seemed as though Jackie was only interested in Kelso because of the way he looked. She didn’t dive deeper to find out more about his personality or characteristics. It was based on his looks alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelso-constantly-flirted-with-donna-in-front-of-jackie><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Kelso Constantly Flirted With Donna In Front Of Jackie</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/70s3-1.jpg><p class=p1>Kelso constantly flirted with Donna in front of Jackie. This is problematic for multiple reasons. The first reason is, Kelso shouldn’t be flirting with other girls in front of his girlfriend. The second reason is… Donna and Jackie are best friends.
