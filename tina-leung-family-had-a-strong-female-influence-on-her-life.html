Tina grew up with her three siblings, Katrina, Alda, and Tawny Leung.</p><p>Leung is a well-known fashion stylist, blogger, and social media influencer, whose work has been featured in Hong Kong editorials such as Marie Claire, Elle, and Harper’s Bazaar.</p><p>She has her own personal blog, Tina Loves. She is notable for her eclectic fashion sense and is a regular fixture on the street style scene.</p><p>Undoubtedly, she is one of Hong Kong’s high-fashion queens and one can hardly pull off that extra look as effortlessly as her.</p><p>The stylist is currently in the limelight for being the cast member of Netflix’s newest reality show Bling Empire: New York, a spinoff of the Bling Empire (2021) series. The series landed on January 20, 2023.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tina-leung-was-born-to-mother-cindy-lo-in-hong-kong></span>Tina Leung Was Born To Mother Cindy Lo In Hong Kong<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tina Leung parents Cindy Lo and executive father relocated to Orange County from Hong Kong. Tina is the first child of her family.</p><p>Later her parents welcomed their second daughter, Alda followed by Tawny and Katrina. They moved back to their homeland nearly a decade later when the blogger was 12.</p><figure></figure><p>In Leung’s&nbsp;own words, they lived in a tiny, tiny suburb with only one supermarket and one car park. Her father was away most of the time since he produced baby products for companies like Gerber and Evenflo.</p><p>Thus, the siblings were often left to their own devices. The four little nuggets loved to bake, ride in their Barbie car and bicycle, and roll around in the grass. They would also sell ladybugs and butterflies for 5 cents.</p><p>She admits that things did change once they moved back to China, yet they still visited Los Angeles, California, every summer. Leung says such trips are how her passion for fashion started.</p><figure></figure><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-three-sisters-have-great-influence-on-her-life></span>Her Three Sisters Have Great Influence On Her Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tina is the eldest of four siblings, and her sisters Alda, Tawny, and Katrina make the occasional appearance on her Instagram.</p><p>It’s essential to note that the Leung household&nbsp;was not always stable, comfortable, or happy for the four sisters growing up. It was partly because of their&nbsp;dad’s travels, financial distress, and their mom’s “crazy” tendencies.</p><p>The fashion blogger has always taken on the key role of protector and paved the way for her younger ones, which they are all grateful for.</p><figure></figure><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=alda-leung></span>Alda Leung<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Alda, the second-born, is a&nbsp;Senior Creative Director&nbsp;at&nbsp;Andie Swim. Her role includes overseeing the marriage of aesthetics, logistics, and marketing. Her life roots are seeded in Hong Kong and Brooklyn.</p><p>Being an art director, she is always attracted to the unexpected, where she acquires new concepts and ideas. She believes her main strength and overarching objective is recognizing and developing cohesive visual solutions.</p><figure></figure><p>Talking more, she studied Fine and Studio Arts at the University of Southern California and later joined Parsons School of Design and earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA). She is active on&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;under the username @aldal.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=tawny-leung></span>Tawny Leung<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Born after Alda, Tawny is happily married to her beloved husband, Julian Chow. Moreover, the loving pair are blessed with a little daughter born in July 2021. The child is currently 2 years old.</p><p>She and her long-time partner, Julian, got&nbsp;engaged&nbsp;in May 2018. The delighted bride-to-be took to her IG handle to flaunt her sparkling ring on May 9.</p><p>After being engaged for a year, the couple finally decided to&nbsp;tie the knot&nbsp;in May 2019. Now, she regularly shares adorable pictures&nbsp;on her&nbsp;Instagram, which goes by the nametag @tawlly, giving followers a glimpse of them.</p><figure></figure><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=katrina-leung></span>Katrina Leung<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The youngest of Leung’s siblings, Katrina is around 12 years younger than her big sister, Tina. She serves as the&nbsp;Director of Awards&nbsp;at The James Beard Foundation and has a clinical research and performing arts background.</p><p>She was just one month old when her parents&nbsp;moved back to Hong Kong from California, the Bling Empire star once shared in her&nbsp;IG.</p><figure></figure><p>She further shared that as they were in the car on the way to their new home from the airport, Katrina was exactly one month to the day. Looking out at the bright lights outside the window, she let out her first giggle, sitting on her big sister’s lap.</p><p>She is available on&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;under the username @katrinaleuf, with 500 posts and 693 followers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-fashionista-has-amassed-an-impressive-fortune-as-a-fashion-icon></span>The Fashionista Has Amassed An Impressive Fortune As A Fashion Icon<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tina Leung has an estimated net worth of&nbsp;$1 million, earned from her career as an influencer, stylist, and blogger.</p><p>In addition, as a cast member of Bling Empire: New York, she’s likely to increase her net worth. However, her Netflix pay isn’t public knowledge. According to&nbsp;Glassdoor, the base salary of Netflix stars is around $158,158 per year.</p><p>Though as per&nbsp;Business Insider, the pay range could differ significantly for reality television stars.</p><p>For those docu-ensembles, mainly if they’re new, the per-episode pay ranges from low-end like $1500 to $3,000 at the high-end. A TV agent further told the outlet, after three years of success, the pay can go up to $7,000-$10,000 per episode.</p><figure></figure><p>Leung is perhaps the most successful and high-earning member of her family. Nonetheless, her youngest siblings are also doing great and have achieved a lot in their related professional fields.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyZo65uuMSupaBllpa6qrjYZp%2BanF2WerTA0ailoGWWmrqiuMRmoKeenKqyr6%2FEZqanZZiav264yJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftina-leung-family-had-a-strong-female-influence-on-her-life.html&text=Tina%20Leung%20Family%20Had%20A%20Strong%20Female%20Influence%20On%20Her%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftina-leung-family-had-a-strong-female-influence-on-her-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftina-leung-family-had-a-strong-female-influence-on-her-life.html&title=Tina%20Leung%20Family%20Had%20A%20Strong%20Female%20Influence%20On%20Her%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftina-leung-family-had-a-strong-female-influence-on-her-life.html&title=Tina%20Leung%20Family%20Had%20A%20Strong%20Female%20Influence%20On%20Her%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftina-leung-family-had-a-strong-female-influence-on-her-life.html&title=Tina%20Leung%20Family%20Had%20A%20Strong%20Female%20Influence%20On%20Her%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftina-leung-family-had-a-strong-female-influence-on-her-life.html&description=Tina%20Leung%20Family%20Had%20A%20Strong%20Female%20Influence%20On%20Her%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tj-kirks-net-worth-in-2022-revealed-as-he-hits-959k-subscribers-on-youtube-channel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tj Kirks Net Worth Revealed As He Hits 959K Subscribers On YouTube Channel">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./john-mayer-taylor-swift-reaction-dear-john-paper-dolls.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Is How John Mayer Responded To The Song Taylor Swift Wrote About Him ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
