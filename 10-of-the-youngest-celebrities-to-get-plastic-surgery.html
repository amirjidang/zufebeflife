Most celebrities don’t deny the work they’ve had done, and why should they? Cosmetic surgery can improve appearances quickly and with relative ease. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASAPS) reported that during 2013, 15.1 million cosmetic procedures were performed; that number grew to 15.6 million over the course of 2014, and is projected to increase more this year.</p><p>According ASAPS, the age range to have the most procedures done was 35-50, which accounted for 40.1% of all the surgeries. Yet a surprising number of surgeries were performed on people who hadn’t even hit middle age: 19-34 year olds accounted for 17.2%. While the smallest age range was 18 and younger, at 1.3%, that still accounted for 203 thousand Americans under the age of 18 to have cosmetic surgery in 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who are these 2.9 million underaged people&nbsp;getting&nbsp;plastic surgery? And is there an age that is too young get plastic surgery? Celebrities are often admired for their chiseled features, but many times those features were crafted by a knife, and sometimes at a young age. We all look at celebrities and sometimes wonder if they have had any work done. Here, some of the youngest celebrities to have gone under the knife are revealed.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston>10. Jennifer Aniston</h2><p>This Friends star definitely has a girl-next-door natural beauty – if the girl next door had also had a nose job as a teen. She came out on&nbsp;Inside the Actor’s Studio in 2007 and explained that a baseball had hit her in the face that led to a deviated septum. It also led to a thinner nose.</p><p>Plastic surgery was something that <a href=#>Jennifer </a>had kept secret. Until 2011, when she finally revealed an answer to a question that America was wondering: was Jennifer born with that beautiful nose or was it surgery? While the surgery did fix a deviated septum, it also sculpted Jennifer’s nose. The actress later went on to get a second rhinoplasty, reportedly to fix the mistakes done during the first one, and to properly fix her deviated&nbsp;septum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian>9. Kourtney Kardashian</h2><p>The Kardashians are always popping up on the Hollywood radar, and many times it is related to their bodies. Kourtney was gifted with a beautiful curvy body but still wanted to augment one part. She admitted in an exclusive interview with Life&Style about getting her breasts&nbsp;done when she was only 22.</p><p>While still in college,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kourtney</a> decided to upgrade from a B-cup to a C-cup for her 22nd birthday. Kourtney said “It was so dumb…There was no talking me out of it”. While she is no longer ashamed of the surgery, she also admitted to being a little remorseful about changing her body.</p><p></p><h2 id=pamela-anderson>8. Pamela Anderson</h2><p>This buxomly lady started her transformation at the age of 22. This seems only natural for <a href=#>Pamela Anderson</a>, whose name represents a sex symbol. From Playboy to Baywatch, Pamela’s breasts were the focus. At their largest, Pamela’s breasts were a 36DDD, and they certainly didn’t start out that size. In 1989, shortly before she was selected to be Playboy’s Playmate of the Year, she went under the knife and began&nbsp;her transformation. Since the age of 22, Pamela has gone up and down in size, alternatively reducing and augmenting her breast size.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=kimberly-stewart>7. Kimberly Stewart</h2><p><a href=#>Kimberly Stewart</a> had her father's consent when she had&nbsp;her first breast enhancement surgery&nbsp;at the ripe age of 18. <a href=#>Rod Stewart</a> was also supportive when Kimberly removed them. The socialite had her implants removed years later, at the age of 26, reportedly for health reasons. What Kimberly did with her rejected implants was quite unique; according to the&nbsp;Daily Mail UK she gifted her implants to <a href=#>Jack Osbourne</a>, which are supposedly signed and framed.</p><p></p><h2 id=denise-richards>6. Denise Richards</h2><p>This beautiful&nbsp;model and actress may have been a touch naïve at the age of 19 when she had her first breast augmentation. Through lack of research, and inexperience, <a href=#>Denise</a> ended up with a botched boob job. It ended up taking 2 more surgeries to fix that first mistake.</p><p>Later Denise told US Weekly that the surgeon put in bigger implants than what she wanted the first time&nbsp;and that is the only reason she regrets having the surgery. According to the&nbsp;Huffington Post; she wishes she had been “confident enough with her&nbsp;body to not have had surgery."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=michael-jackson>5. Michael Jackson</h2><p>The King of Pop spent thirty years changing himself; <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> represents one of the most shocking overall transformations in Hollywood history. About one&nbsp;hundred procedures were done on Michael, and they all started with a nose job in 1979, at the age of 21.</p><p>This first procedure, according to Michael’s biographer,&nbsp;J. Randy Taraborrelli, was done after Michael had broken his nose during a dance rehearsal. Even with such innocent beginnings, it became clear how far Michael was willing to go in order to change his appearance. Perhaps his young age during his first procedure played a part in the extreme number of surgeries. By 1990, about ten years after that first surgery, it has been estimated that he had undergone ten more procedures.</p><p></p><h2 id=jenny-mccarthy>4. Jenny McCarthy</h2><p>A playboy model, television host, actress and comedian, <a href=#>Jenny McCarthy</a> is an American bombshell who seems to have had it all. Yet she was so unhappy with her body that at the age of 19 she had a bargain boob job that was more than she bargained for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course in the line of work that made her famous, Playboy modeling, breasts are important. The story of how she had them done though is harrowing: Jenny told World Entertainment News Network how she and her friends found a surgeon in Arizona who did the surgery for only $1,500. It turned out that it was so cheap because he didn’t use anesthesia. Kenny later told US Weekly that she had been “too young” for the surgery, and it took two more surgeries to fix the job.</p><p></p><h2 id=heidi-montag>3. Heidi Montag</h2><p>Former “Hills” star, <a href=#>Heidi Montag</a>, was not only young when she had her first surgery, she also went all out and soon after had another ten surgeries in one day. At the age of 21 she had a rhinoplasty and a breast augmentation (from an A-cup to a C-cup). The star came out to US Weekly and reported that she had always been insecure about her body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As if that wasn’t enough, Heidi, only 3 years later at the age of 24, decided she wanted more. Ten more to be exact. In a single day she had a brow lift, a nose job, her ears pinned, chin shaved, a second breast augmentation, her back scooped out, neck liposuction, fat injected into her cheekbones and liposuction on her inner and outer thighs and waist. Later, though, Heidi regretted the surgeries and even had her breasts downsized from an F cup to a D-cup.</p><p></p><h2 id=courtney-stodden>2. Courtney Stodden</h2><p>Courtney was always a controversial figure, having married actor <a href=#>Doug Hutchison</a> in 2011 when she was only 16 and he was 51. Then, at 18, she had a breast augmentation that took her from a C-cup double Ds.</p><p>Courtney was never ashamed of her upgrade, and was very public about it. The blonde bombshell even posted a video online documenting her plastic surgery; from her trip to the office and even inside the operating room. The short film ends with Courtney's bandages being taken off, as her husband, and her doctor examine her.</p><p></p><h2 id=farrah-abraham>1. Farrah Abraham</h2><p>This Teen Mom has had&nbsp;a lot of work done to her body. <a href=#>Farrah</a> reported to In Touch that "I want to look my best. And I'm looking amazing". When Farrah was 16 she got pregnant, making her a star, and then at 19 she went under the knife for breast implants. Her first breast augmentation brought her from an A to a C-cup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The mom-turned-sex-tape-star underwent a second breast augmentation surgery three days after her 22nd birthday, upgrading her cup size from a C to a D. That was the fourth time Farrah had gone under the knife in less than three years. Overall Farrah&nbsp;has spent almost $30,000 on a nose job, chin implant and two breast surgeries, In Touch reports, that she&nbsp;won’t be stopping any time soon.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>eonline.com</a>, <a href=#>radaronline.com</a>, <a href=#>radaronline.com</a>, <a href=#>justjared.com</a>, <a href=#>usmagazine.com</a>, <a href=#>eonline.com</a>, <a href=#>eonline.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2ks27Ax55ksqelo7Smv9Nmmp6klZe%2FqsDInqpmrJ9itKbAjKmjmquknrBuv9Srnp6qqWQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-of-the-youngest-celebrities-to-get-plastic-surgery.html&text=10%20Of%20The%20Youngest%20Celebrities%20To%20Get%20Plastic%20Surgery&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-of-the-youngest-celebrities-to-get-plastic-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-of-the-youngest-celebrities-to-get-plastic-surgery.html&title=10%20Of%20The%20Youngest%20Celebrities%20To%20Get%20Plastic%20Surgery" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-of-the-youngest-celebrities-to-get-plastic-surgery.html&title=10%20Of%20The%20Youngest%20Celebrities%20To%20Get%20Plastic%20Surgery" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-of-the-youngest-celebrities-to-get-plastic-surgery.html&title=10%20Of%20The%20Youngest%20Celebrities%20To%20Get%20Plastic%20Surgery" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-of-the-youngest-celebrities-to-get-plastic-surgery.html&description=10%20Of%20The%20Youngest%20Celebrities%20To%20Get%20Plastic%20Surgery" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-lesser-known-facts-about-jon-moxley-and-renee-youngs-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Lesser Known Facts About Jon Moxley And Renee Young's Relationship">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-highest-grossing-eddie-murphy-movies-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Highest-Grossing Eddie Murphy Movies, Ranked">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
