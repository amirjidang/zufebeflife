This intriguing question has lingered in the minds of football fans for years, and former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Bart Scott recently spilled the beans on ESPN’s “Get Up.” He candidly admitted that Ward had managed to infiltrate his psyche during their on-field battles.&nbsp;In jest, Scott revealed that it took five years of therapy to suppress the urge to punch Ward in the face.</p><p>But that’s not the only question surrounding the enigmatic Hines Ward. Did Hines Ward win Dancing with the Stars? Yes, he did. Hines Edward Ward, Jr. emerged as the victorious celebrity from Season 12 of the popular dance competition show, “Dancing with the Stars.” The man whose name struck fear into the hearts of defenders on the football field also wowed audiences with his moves on the dance floor.</p><p>The ongoing&nbsp;saga&nbsp;of Hines Ward and his adversaries took another twist when Terrell Suggs, another former Raven, revealed on the syndicated radio show “2 Live Stews” that there was a “bounty” placed on Ward. This revelation followed Bart Scott’s emotional reaction after being on the receiving end of a punishing block by Ward.</p><p>But is this “bounty” talk justified? Some argue that it’s time for the Ravens’ defense to focus on playing football rather than engaging in off-field chatter. Hines Ward has been the embodiment of what football should be – a sport of intensity, physicality, and unwavering dedication.</p><p>In an era where wide receivers often gain notoriety for flamboyant antics and diva-like behavior, Hines Ward stood apart. He exemplified the essence of the game, consistently blocking with tenacity, receiving with grace, and smiling through it all.</p><p>Ward’s willingness to sacrifice his body for the good of the team didn’t go unnoticed. Linebackers like Bart Scott, safeties like Ed Reed, and countless others experienced the full force of Ward’s formidable blocking skills.</p><p>In today’s NFL, where some view delivering bone-crushing blocks as “dirty,” Hines Ward remains a beacon of old-school football values. He relishes the physicality of the sport and embraces the hits that come with it. When he takes a hit, he doesn’t seek retribution or call for a “bounty.” Instead, he rises with a grin and heads back to the huddle, ready for the next play.</p><p>Hines Ward’s career stats already make a compelling case for his Hall of Fame candidacy, but what truly sets him apart is his unwavering commitment to playing football the way it was meant to be played.</p><p>So, to the Ravens and all those who criticize Ward’s style, the message is clear: stop complaining to the public and let your actions on the field speak. When Hines Ward crosses the middle, take your best shot, put him on the ground if you can, and brace for his trademark smile as he bounces back to continue doing what he does best – playing football, the way it’s meant to be played.</p><p>As Ward’s storied career continues to inspire, one thing remains certain: he has a lot more football to play, and he’s not about to let anyone’s complaints change his game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyZmXqptc2eqmavkaexbsPIp2SdmZ6Ytq%2BzjLCgraBdqbWmedKtmKurXay1osCMnaCdZZieu6a%2FjLCYq5xdmbxuwM5mmZqqpGLApLvTrWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-hines-ward-win-dancing-with-the-stars-what-did-hines-ward-do-to-bart-scott.html&text=Did%20Hines%20Ward%20Win%20Dancing%20With%20The%20Stars%3f%20What%20Did%20Hines%20Ward%20Do%20To%20Bart%20Scott%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-hines-ward-win-dancing-with-the-stars-what-did-hines-ward-do-to-bart-scott.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-hines-ward-win-dancing-with-the-stars-what-did-hines-ward-do-to-bart-scott.html&title=Did%20Hines%20Ward%20Win%20Dancing%20With%20The%20Stars%3f%20What%20Did%20Hines%20Ward%20Do%20To%20Bart%20Scott%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-hines-ward-win-dancing-with-the-stars-what-did-hines-ward-do-to-bart-scott.html&title=Did%20Hines%20Ward%20Win%20Dancing%20With%20The%20Stars%3f%20What%20Did%20Hines%20Ward%20Do%20To%20Bart%20Scott%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-hines-ward-win-dancing-with-the-stars-what-did-hines-ward-do-to-bart-scott.html&title=Did%20Hines%20Ward%20Win%20Dancing%20With%20The%20Stars%3f%20What%20Did%20Hines%20Ward%20Do%20To%20Bart%20Scott%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-hines-ward-win-dancing-with-the-stars-what-did-hines-ward-do-to-bart-scott.html&description=Did%20Hines%20Ward%20Win%20Dancing%20With%20The%20Stars%3f%20What%20Did%20Hines%20Ward%20Do%20To%20Bart%20Scott%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./does-cameron-champ-have-a-girlfriend-everything-to-know-about-his-dating-history-287168-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Cameron Champ Have A Girlfriend?
