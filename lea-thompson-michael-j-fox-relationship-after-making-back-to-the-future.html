Fox, is a high school student whose best friend builds a time machine. Marty's only chance of survival after being accidentally transported back in time 30 years is to make his mother, played by Lea Thompson, fall in love with his father, played by Crispin Glover.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How have the mother and son from Back to the Future felt about the filming of the movie and about each other since 1985?</p><h2 id=michael-j-fox-always-felt-ldquo-weird-rdquo-about-the-back-to-the-future-mother-son-plot>Michael J. Fox Always Felt “Weird” About The Back To The Future Mother-Son Plot</h2><p>In a conversation with Variety, Fox discussed the idea behind Back to the Future. He explained that the movie had a "bizarre" concept, adding that he had the same impression at the time.</p><p>“There’s something about it that people still respond to because it’s so weird. Not to be crude, but it’s a movie about almost f*cking your mom, and she’s totally ready for it. Even at the time, I realized it was bizarre.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2-7.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fox acknowledges he wasn't always on his game during filming Back to the Future, despite his earlier acknowledgment of the film's out-of-the-ordinary premise.</p><p>Fox, who was also <a href=#>filming the sitcom Family Ties at the same time</a>, rarely got any rest, sleeping for only a few hours a night before starting another all-nighter. According to Fox, this made the actor feel quite lost in real life, which was useful for playing Marty McFly.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Michael J. Fox's Dark Personal Struggles</a></span></p><p>Although Fox found the mother-son scenario to be completely out there, Thompson saw things very differently.</p><p>Thompson, who played Marty's mother in the film and its sequels, told People at the film's 30th anniversary celebration in 2015 that she still treasured an item from the infamous dance scene with Fox.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/5-4.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was beautifully made, and made to order for me," she described the dress she wore. "It's got a low-drop waist, and the way it was cut was just so beautiful. And it's still in great shape. I've still got the shoes. The shoes are even hard to get on now — my big ol' feet from having babies."</p><p>Thompson, though, has come to appreciate the film's enduring popularity over time.</p><p>"It seems like the last few years, it seems to have really taken that on," she said. "I mean, when I realized that my mother-in-law was watching the movie with her daughter, her daughter's daughter, and her daughter's daughter. I was like, 'Wow! That's the coolest thing ever.'"</p><p>Perhaps Fox and Thompson can agree to disagree.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lea-thompson-got-emotional-over-seeing-her-on-screen-son-michael-j-fox-reach-retirement-age>Lea Thompson Got Emotional Over Seeing Her On-Screen Son Michael J.

Wilson says, "Hello, anybody home?" while playfully knocking on Thompson's skull in one of the videos, alluding to one of his character's most memorable lines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the caption "Found the flux capacitor," Lloyd uploaded a photo of the four actors.

Heavy.”</p><p>Although several of them did meet up online in 2020 for Josh Gad's Reunited Apart series, nothing beats really being in the same room again, does it? Many of them have fond memories of the cast and crew of 1985's Back To The Future, so it's nice to see them enjoying themselves so much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Back-to-the-Future-cast.png><p>Despite having possibly the strangest on-screen interaction ever, it is a delight to see Fox and Thompson together.</p><p>Overall, the relationship between Michael J.
