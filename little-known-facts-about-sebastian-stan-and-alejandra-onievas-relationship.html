However, it was his role as <strong>Bucky Barnes</strong> in the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></strong> that endeared him to fans. The mysterious and dangerous appeal of Bucky cemented Sebastian’s status as an internet boyfriend, making his personal life a focal point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Fans Really Thought Of Sebastian Stan As Bucky Barnes</a></span></p><p>However, despite living most of his life in the spotlight, the actor has a knack for being secretive with his love life. Due to his killer looks, great sense of humor, and overall bad boy vibe, Sebastian has dated a host of A-listers, but it has never worked out. Now, he has a new woman in his life, Alejandro Onieva, and here are some rare facts about their budding relationship.</p><h2 id=who-is-alejandra-onieva><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Who Is Alejandra Onieva?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Alejandra might not be as famous as her beau, she is quite the deal in Spain. She is a renowned actress who rose to fame for her in the 2011 soap opera El Secreto de Puente Viejo. Her other acting credits include Presunto Culpable, For A Handful of Kisses, Novatos, and Ella es tu Padre. However, her appearance in the 2019 Netflix mystery drama, High Seas, exposed her to the international community. She is also a model who has worked with brands like DKNY and Max&Co.</p><h2 id=they-began-dating-amid-the-pandemic><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>They Began Dating Amid The Pandemic</span></h2><p>While the rest of the world was holed up at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Sebastian and Alejandra were busy falling for each other. The couple first made headlines in July when the MCU star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was spotted in Ibiza, Spain, enjoying a romantic time with Alejandra on a yacht</a>. It was initially suspected to be a summer fling, but Alejandra returned to New York with the actor. They were spotted running errands in August.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Sebastian Stan Felt About His 'MCU' Co-Star Dating Taylor Swift</a></span></p><h2 id=a-10-year-age-difference><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>A 10-Year Age Difference</span></h2><p>Like most couples in Hollywood, Sebastian and Alejandra have a significant age difference between them, and it seems to work well for their relationship. The Winter Soldier star was born in 1982 and is set to turn 39 on August 13, 2021. Alejandra, on the other hand, turned 29 on June 1, 2021. Nevertheless, it’s hard to tell the difference in their age as they both have killer bodies that make them look years younger.</p><h2 id=she-was-the-first-to-make-things-instagram-official><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Was The First To Make Things Instagram Official</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, the dynamics and standards for celebrity relationships have evolved. In recent times, the act of sharing each other’s photos on social media and making red carpet debuts signify the confirmation of a romance. Although Sebastian has eventually come out of his shell to post pictures of his woman on Instagram, Alejandra made the first move.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Say Sebastian Stan Has An Interesting Hollywood Connection</a></span></p><p>Back in July, after they were first spotted in Ibiza, the Spanish actress uploaded <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an idyllic photo of them on a jetski in the sunset</a>. However, she didn’t tag him. It wasn’t until December 2020 that she made things properly official after tagging him on a post. She uploaded pictures of their shadows with a caption that read, “walking on a dream.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-are-both-heavy-on-pda><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Are Both Heavy On PDA</span></h2><p>Although Sebastian and Alejandra kept their relationship under the wraps for a long time, the lovebirds were not afraid of putting up a steamy display for the paparazzi during their romantic getaways. During a vacation in Tulum, Mexico, the couple was seen cuddling and kissing in the water while putting their banging bodies on display. Once while walking around in New York, the duo held hands as they rocked matching white shirts.</p><h2 id=sebastian-wanted-to-keep-the-relationship-private><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sebastian Wanted To Keep The Relationship Private</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although his job requires him to be in the spotlight, Sebastian is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">known for being overly secretive with his love life</a>, but for his relationship with Alejandra, he took his love for privacy a bit far. Before the couple became Instagram official, it was believed that Sebastian was keeping things lowkey because he and Alejandra were living in different countries. The actor was wary about moving too fast because of the challenges of a long-distance relationship.</p><h2 id=neither-was-born-in-the-u-s><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Neither Was Born In The U.S.</span></h2><p>One thing that often brings people together in relationships is having something in common. Sebastian and Alejandra undoubtedly share similar attributes, given that they are both actors and quite attractive. However, unknown to many, they have similar backgrounds. Both of them weren’t born in the United States. Although Sebastian is a U.S citizen, he was born in Constanta, Romania. He moved to the U.S as a child after his mom remarried and didn’t become a citizen until 2002. Alejandra was born and raised in Madrid, Spain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-asian-scandal><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Asian Scandal</span></h2><p>Although Sebastian and Alejandra look good together on paper, social media stans of the actor are not fans of their relationship. The couple was on the receiving end of backlash after a 2018 photo of Alejandra resurfaced, showing her and a friend dressed in kimonos, with white faces and red lipsticks <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">during an event they tagged “Asian Nights</a>.”</p><p>Fans attacked Alejandra, calling her racist and accusing her of cultural appropriation. Sebastian was tagged to many of the tweets, with his fans asking him to address the matter. Instead, the actor blocked them. Although the photo was eventually deleted from Alejandra’s page, the wrath of fans led to the trending of #sebastianstanisoverparty in the hopes that he is canceled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-heartwarming-birthday-tribute><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>A Heartwarming Birthday Tribute</span></h2><p>After almost a year of being together, Sebastian finally openly acknowledged his love for Alejandra in a touching tribute on her 29th birthday. The actor uploaded a romantic yet hilarious video where he recreated a day with his girl from waking up together, having breakfast, doing yoga, playing games, and having date nights. However, the catch to the video was that Alejandra wasn’t in the video in person. It was a picture of her on his phone. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The lovely clip was captioned</a>:</p><p>“Happy Birthday @ale_onieva!! Over a year ago, out of a lot of darkness...you became the light. I’m so grateful #2020 #loveinthetimeofcovid #quarantinenights.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sebastian-s-dating-history><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sebastian’s Dating History</span></h2><p>Before Alejandra became the love of Sebastian’s life, the actor has been linked to many high-profile women in the industry. His first famous relationship was with Gossip Girl co-star Leighton Meester. The pair fell in love on set and dated for two years before their split. Sebastian moved on to actress Dianna Agron, but the duo called it quits after just a year. The MCU star was soon linked to his Once Upon A Time co-star, Jennifer Morrison, but their romance quickly fizzled out. His last known relationship before Alejandra was with Margarita Levieva.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened Between Sebastian Stan And Ex, Leighton Meester?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoqykobJut82orqdllpawtb%2BMmpmoraRiwKauwKyropmeYsC1rc1mmKecXZa5prbAp5urmV2ku6qx1ZqqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flittle-known-facts-about-sebastian-stan-and-alejandra-onievas-relationship.html&text=Little-Known%20Facts%20About%20Sebastian%20Stan%20And%20Alejandra%20Onieva%27s%20Relationship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flittle-known-facts-about-sebastian-stan-and-alejandra-onievas-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flittle-known-facts-about-sebastian-stan-and-alejandra-onievas-relationship.html&title=Little-Known%20Facts%20About%20Sebastian%20Stan%20And%20Alejandra%20Onieva%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flittle-known-facts-about-sebastian-stan-and-alejandra-onievas-relationship.html&title=Little-Known%20Facts%20About%20Sebastian%20Stan%20And%20Alejandra%20Onieva%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flittle-known-facts-about-sebastian-stan-and-alejandra-onievas-relationship.html&title=Little-Known%20Facts%20About%20Sebastian%20Stan%20And%20Alejandra%20Onieva%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flittle-known-facts-about-sebastian-stan-and-alejandra-onievas-relationship.html&description=Little-Known%20Facts%20About%20Sebastian%20Stan%20And%20Alejandra%20Onieva%27s%20Relationship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lizbeth-medina.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lizbeth Medina, a16 Year Old, Texas High School Cheerleader Found Dead in her Apartment">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./la-la-vazquez-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="La La Vazquez Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
