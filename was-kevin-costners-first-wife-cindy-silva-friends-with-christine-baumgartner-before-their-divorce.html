Details of this interaction haven't been made public, but it's possible that Silva was at the golf course and talked to Baumgartner as well.</p><p>No one knows if there was any kind of chemistry between Costner and Baumgartner when they had this first conversation.

The source said, "Christine wants them to spend family time at their Santa Barbara home. During filming, Kevin is not around very much. His absence has been very hard for her. Christine doesn't want him to throw himself into another project. He has been obsessed with filming Horizon since last year.
