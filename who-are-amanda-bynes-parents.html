Unlike Britney, however, Amanda always had the support of her parents, Lynn and Rick Bynes. Perhaps this is why <a href=#>Amanda's conservatorship did not get the same recognition as Britney's</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The ultimate goal was to ensure the Easy A star got the help she needed to keep her mental health issues and <a href=#>bipolar disorder that caused her to feud with others</a> in check, so the conservatorship could end. There was not an alterer motive and Amanda's conservatorship was not exploited for her parents to monetarily benefit. Because of this, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when Amanda had made "significant progress" with the direction of her life</a> and wanted the conservatorship to end, her parents fully backed her.</p><p><a href=#>Amanda's conservatorship officially ended in 2022</a>. However, <a href=#>steps had been taken well before this time to terminate it</a>. As such, when the day came, Amanda and her parents signed court documents that officially put the Hairspray star back in charge of both her finances and medical care.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Amanda Bynes' Plans Following The End Of Her Conservatorship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since taking her care back into her own hands, there have been some hiccups along the way. <a href=#>The most recent downward spiral</a> culminated in a 5150 hold after Amanda was found naked and alone wandering the streets of Los Angeles in March 2023. After completing a several-week treatment program, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She's the Man star voluntarily checked out of inpatient treatment</a>.</p><p>Treatment would continue on an outpatient basis, with the hopes that whatever caused the relapse could be dealt with. But even with this happening, Lynn and Rick did not want to put Amanda back under a conservatorship, perhaps hoping that Amanda could make better choices in life without being told how to live it.</p><h2 id=who-are-amanda-bynes-39-parents>Who Are Amanda Bynes' Parents?</h2><p>Amanda's parents are Lynn and Rick Bynes. They have three children, Amanda, of which is the youngest. Both Rick and Lynn are working parents. Rick is a dentist and Lynn is an assistant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During Amanda's conservatorship, her parents were supportive of her. However, Lynn was the one who was in charge of the conservatorship. The finances fell to Rick, who took Amanda's money and put it into a trust while she was under the conservatorship. That trust was under Rick's care until Amanda's conservatorship came to an end.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar45964478-1.jpg><p>In the midst of Amanda's conservatorship, she experienced some triumphs as well as appeared to backtrack at times. The biggest slide came in 2014 when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanda accused her father of some serious allegations</a> via Twitter.</p><p>Those allegations included that he was "sexually, verbally, and physically abusive" of Amanda while she was growing up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following day, however, the tweets were gone. In their place was another, more bizarre tweet that left fans wondering what was happening with Amanda.</p><p>"My dad never did any of those things," Amanda tweeted. "The microchip in my brain made me say those things but he's the one that ordered them to microchip me."</p><p>This passed and Amanda was taken off her conservatorship. It appeared that she was in control of her life and ready to move on from her past.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Amanda Bynes Got Kicked Out Of Her NYC Apartment After Complaints Of How It Smelled</a></span></p><p>To move on, Amanda moved from California to New York City in 2022. Amanda's parents trusted her and her ability to make good decisions and were encouraged she was going to fashion design school.</p><p>But, a short time after moving to the Big Apple, Amanda took to social media to make some false claims. Claims that included that she was engaged, needed a "tremendous amount of facial surgery" and "will not be manipulated or brainwashed by anyone."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When this happened, questions were raised about whether <a href=#>Amanda's parents would be placing her under a conservatorship again</a>—a question they quickly answered.</p><h2 id=are-amanda-bynes-39-mom-and-dad-behind-the-conservatorship>Are Amanda Bynes' Mom And Dad Behind The Conservatorship?</h2><p>When Amanda was put under a conservatorship, it absolutely was her parents who made the decision to do this. After all, they could no longer trust what Amanda was going to do and were concerned for her physical safety and mental well-being.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Not to mention that Amanda herself called this the "dark period" in her life</a>.; help was needed and needed quickly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar45965748.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, Amanda lit a fire in the driveway of her neighbor's home. This happened as a result of "mental health and substance abuse issues." Sensing that things would escalate if they did not step in, Amanda's parents requested a conservatorship while Amanda was placed on a psychiatric hold. That request was granted by the court.</p><p>The temporary conservatorship was supposed to end in 2016. However, it was deemed necessary by the court to extend it to 2020. During this time, it was only the "health care and personal matters" that Lynn was in charge of. Amanda was given the right to do with her trust as she saw fit.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Amanda Show May Not Have Paid Amanda Bynes The Fortune That Fans Think</a></span></p><p>Even though Lynn had the ability to determine the healthcare Amanda received, she was willing to concede that when Amanda started to do better, she had the capability of being able to take care of herself.</p><p>Both she and Amanda petitioned the court in 2022 to end the conservatorship, which the court granted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the latest mental break, curiosity abounded about whether Amanda would go back under a conservatorship. And by all accounts, her parents have no plans to try to make this happen.</p><h2 id=amanda-bynes-39-mom-put-a-stop-to-her-wedding-planning>Amanda Bynes' Mom Put A Stop To Her Wedding Planning</h2><p>When Amanda was in rehab, she met a man named Paul Michael. Over the course of two to three months, the two dated. And it was after this timeframe that Paul proposed and Amanda was engaged.</p><p>But in order for her to legally get married, she would have to okay the marriage with her mother given that Lynn was in charge of making life decisions for Amanda under the conservatorship. And because of this, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lynn reportedly put a stop to Amanda's wedding planning</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar44305436-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Valentine's Day 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanda announced on Instagram that she had gotten engaged to "tha love of my life."</a> And while it seemed like exciting news to fans of the former child actor, nothing would ever come from the engagement because Lynn put her foot down on the matter.</p><p>"As Amanda’s conservator, her mother has responsibility over her daughter’s decision-making, including whether or not to allow her to marry," explained Neama Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers.</p><p>"If Amanda’s parents did not consent to the marriage, they can petition the court to annul the marriage on the basis of Amanda’s ‘unsound mind.’"</p><p>Paul and Amanda would break up a few times over the next several months, with the last time being before Amanda's mental break in April 2023. After that, <a href=#>very little has been heard about Paul</a>. As such, it looks as though Lynn knew what she was talking about when she denied Amanda the ability to get married to Paul, as the two were not a match made in heaven.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecCmmKeckWKvurrErGSpmaKau7W%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-amanda-bynes-parents.html&text=Amanda%20Bynes%27%20Parents%20Might%20Not%20Want%20To%20Be%20As%20Involved%20In%20Her%20Life%20Anymore&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-amanda-bynes-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-amanda-bynes-parents.html&title=Amanda%20Bynes%27%20Parents%20Might%20Not%20Want%20To%20Be%20As%20Involved%20In%20Her%20Life%20Anymore" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-are-amanda-bynes-parents.html&title=Amanda%20Bynes%27%20Parents%20Might%20Not%20Want%20To%20Be%20As%20Involved%20In%20Her%20Life%20Anymore" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-amanda-bynes-parents.html&title=Amanda%20Bynes%27%20Parents%20Might%20Not%20Want%20To%20Be%20As%20Involved%20In%20Her%20Life%20Anymore" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-amanda-bynes-parents.html&description=Amanda%20Bynes%27%20Parents%20Might%20Not%20Want%20To%20Be%20As%20Involved%20In%20Her%20Life%20Anymore" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ashley-iaconetti.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ashley Iaconetti News - Us Weekly">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1234484-aj-francis-wwes-most-wanted-treasures-kid-in-a-candy-store.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="AJ Francis Is Like A Kid In A Candy Shop On WWEs Most Wanted Treasures, Wants To Be W">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
