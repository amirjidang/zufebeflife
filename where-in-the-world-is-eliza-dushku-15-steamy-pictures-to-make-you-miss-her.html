Eliza Dushku is totally fine, but I'm not. I’m very concerned about the fact that Eliza Dushku has been missing from the limelight for some time now. Where is she and why is she not on my TV?</p><p>In the late ‘90s and early 2000s, Eliza Dushku seemed like a hot rising star. Dushku appeared on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the spin-off Angel. After this, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joss Whedon</a>, creator of Buffy and Angel, created Dollhouse, in which Eliza Dushku starred. Oh, and she didn’t just dominate the small screen. Eliza Dushku was also on the big screen, appearing in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, The New Guy and, of course, Bring It On. Eliza Dushku as the bad girl cheerleader in Bring It On was everything. And that was her thing: playing the bad girl. There was no one else who played the bad girl quite as good as Eliza Dushku. That said, Eliza Dushku was obviously a major crush for many guys. And then she disappeared. Poof, she's gone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, let’s revisit Eliza Dushku’s hottest pictures and try to figure out why Hollywood isn’t casting Eliza Dushku in every single movie and television show ever. And no, Eliza Dushku did not pay me to write this article. I just love her.</p><h2 id=because-who-needs-a-shirt>Because Who Needs A Shirt?</h2><p>One of the reasons Eliza Dushku is so smokin’ hot is because her look has an edge to it, as is evident in the above photo. Dushku’s edge, so to speak, may come from the fact that she loves to wear black clothes. Like, she wears A LOT of black clothing. Have some fun and just count all the photos of her in black clothing in this article alone. It's a lot. In fact, Eliza Dushku may actually not even own clothing any other color.</p><p>The black clothing aside, Eliza Dushku is also not a blonde Barbie doll of a girl. She has dark hair and dark eyes, which give her a certain <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a>-esque look. And yes, I know Angelina technically has hazel eyes, but when you think of a dark mistress type celebrity, Angelina is the first person to come to mind. That said, Eliza Dushku and Angelina Jolie also share a love of action roles and playing bad girl characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oh, and by the way, Eliza Dushku’s body… I mean…</p><h2 id=oh-to-be-that-fur-blanket>Oh, To Be That Fur Blanket</h2><p>Once again, Eliza Dushku is wearing black clothing, because duh. Also, is Eliza Dushku the dark mistress of everyone’s dreams or what?</p><p>In this photo, Dushku is lounging out on some kind of fur rug. However, Eliza Dushku is actually a vegan, Well, kind of a vegan. She was reportedly on the vegan route after watching Forks over Knives, but tweeted that she was cheating on veganism because she couldn’t resist her grandma’s meatballs, which really just makes her all the more lovable.</p><p>One of Eliza Dushku’s first roles was alongside one of Hollywood’s leading vegans: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. Yep, Leo is a vegan, because he is probably the second coming of Jesus Christ. If you don’t think Leo was born to save us all, I don’t know what’s wrong with you. But I digress. It was 1993's This Boy's Life that Dushku and DiCaprio were both in together.</p><h2 id=a-one-piece-swimsuit-never-looked-so-hot>A One-Piece Swimsuit Never Looked So Hot</h2><p>One-piece swimsuits have recently had a resurgence. Once upon a time, the bikini reigned supreme, which makes sense. Bikinis generally show a lot more skin, so naturally they are sexier. Recently, though, one-piece swimsuits have been giving bikinis a true run for their money. Case in point: the above one-piece swimsuit Eliza Dushku is rocking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The one-piece swimsuit on Eliza Dushku is black, because duh. But it’s also very, very low cut. One could even call that neckline plunging, which is something bikinis really can’t do. The bottom portion of the swimsuit is also cut very high, showing off ample thigh and Dushku’s nearly hidden tattoo.</p><p>Honestly, it would be hard to make a case for any bikini being hotter than this one-piece swimsuit on Eliza Dushku. See ya never, bikinis.</p><h2 id=why-would-anyone-ever-leave-this-bed>Why Would Anyone Ever Leave This Bed?</h2><p>Clearly, Eliza Dushku has both a beautiful face and a beautiful body. I mean. I’m fairly certain that no man with a pulse would willingly leave that bed... ever. Also, shout out to that bit of nude-pink on Eliza Dushku’s bra. Way to add a little color to that mostly black wardrobe, Eliza Dushku.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eliza Dushku’s next big break came in playing Faith on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Oddly enough, it may have actually been playing the character Faith that contributed to Eliza Dushku’s love of all black everything. Apparently, Dushku was to attend Suffolk University in Boston, when her agent asked her to submit an audition tape for Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Dushku read the script then went to Claire’s to buy dark makeup and dark accessories. (I’m thinking a lot of rings and a black choker, right?) After Faith-ing up her look, Eliza Dushku shot the audition tape and the rest is history.</p><p>Oh, and she never stopped wearing black.</p><h2 id=because-eliza-dushku-loves-wearing-black>Because Eliza Dushku Loves Wearing Black</h2><p>So, that little bit of pink in Eliza Dushku’s last bra was apparently a fluke, because we’re back to all black everything. In this photo, Eliza Dushku is also wearing a sheer black dress, because lord knows every woman should own a floor-length sheer black dress.</p><p>In order to work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Eliza Dushku had to be emancipated from her parents. Don't worry, there were no issues at home. There was nothing personal or emotional about this process, it was simply just that as a minor, Eliza Dushku could only work the long production hours if she was emancipated. Ah, rules.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, the judge who handled the emancipation case was a big fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (uh, because it was awesome). The judge said she would only grant Eliza Dushku emancipation if she could get a signed photo of the actress.</p><h2 id=on-buffy-the-vampire-slayer>On Buffy The Vampire Slayer</h2><p>Okay, but let’s talk about Eliza Dushku’s character on Buffy the Vampire Slayer because she was MEGA hot.</p><p>Eliza Dushku’s Faith was introduced during season three of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In the fantasy world of BTVS, there was only one vampire slayer at a time. When one slayer died, a new slayer would get her powers. Makes sense, but things got screwy. In season one, Buffy drowned for a hot minute. At that point, Kendra got her powers. Because of this, there were two active slayers in season two, even though it was only supposed to be one slayer at a time. Near the end of season two, Kendra was killed by Darla, who truly may have been one of the most annoying vampires of all time. Kendra’s death then activated Faith’s slayer powers, which is how both Buffy and Faith came to be slayers at the same time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a character, Faith was a perfect foil to Buffy. Being that Buffy came from a relatively happy home, it was easy for her to take on the role of the good guy, making the right decisions and not taking advantage of her powers. Faith, however, came from a troubled background, which made her resolve to the good side very shaky.</p><p>Eliza Dushku's Faith was intended for a five-episode arc, but her character was so popular that she stayed on throughout season three. Faith also returned for a two-episode arc in season four and the final stretch of the series in season seven.</p><h2 id=the-slayer-sisters-of-your-dreams>The Slayer Sisters Of Your Dreams</h2><p>It’s very possible one of the reasons Faith was so popular was because of her, errr, special connection to Buffy. Like, very special connection to Buffy. While the two characters never actually hooked up, there was admittedly a lot of tension between Faith and Buffy. Let us not forget the time Faith and Buffy switched bodies and Faith, in Buffy’s body, had sex with Buffy’s boyfriend. That was oddly sexual. There was also the time Faith tried to seduce Angel to get him to come to the dark side.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So yeah, there was a lot of sexual tension, even if both women were straight, female characters. Most likely, this is because they were the only two characters who understood each other's bodies. None of the other characters - human, vampire, or demon - understood the body of the slayer quite like, well, the slayers. Because of this unspoken tension, A LOT of fanfiction about Buffy and Faith&nbsp;is out there on the web. I’m serious, just Google and you’ll find a treasure trove of Buffy/Faith fanfiction.</p><p>Also, Eliza Dushku and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> were probably the two hottest things about the early 2000s.</p><h2 id=also-slaying-the-red-carpet>Also Slaying The Red Carpet</h2><p>Eliza Dushku slayed (literally) on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but she also slays (figuratively) the red carpet. I mean, girlfriend is just a drop dead gorgeous human being, so I feel like there’s really no way for her to look bad. That said, Dushku looks exceptionally hot while rocking this (what else?) black spaghetti-strap dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2000, Eliza Dushku starred alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kirsten Dunst</a> in Bring It On, which is an underrated classic. I mean, just so we can all be clear about how great Bring It On is, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Ebert</a> described it as the "Citizen Kane of cheerleader movies" and I'm pretty sure he meant that as a compliment.</p><p>In Bring It On, Dushku played Missy Pantone, the unwilling cheerleader who is only a cheerleader because the high school doesn’t have a gymnastics team. Once again, Dushku was playing a foil to the blonde, good girl, though this time is was Kirsten Dunst instead of Sarah Michelle Gellar.</p><p>Also, shout out to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gabrielle Union</a>, who was the head cheerleader on the rival team, the Clovers.</p><h2 id=eliza-dushku-in-dollhouse>Eliza Dushku In Dollhouse</h2><p>After Bring It On, Eliza Dushku appeared in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, The New Guy, and Wrong Turn, none of which were strong enough to blast her into the next stage of her film career. However, her television career was still going strong. Dushku continued appearing on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She also appeared in six episodes of the BTVS spin-off, Angel. From there, Eliza Dushku’s next biggest television role was in Joss Whedon’s Dollhouse. Dushku played Echo, a “doll” who would be programmed with a personality, complete a task for a client, then have her memory and personality wiped clean. The show followed Echo on her journey towards self-awareness. So, Westworld before Westworld. Though, the show didn’t receive the same critical acclaim as Westworld and was cancelled after only two seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, the idea of Eliza Dushku dressing up as a different character with a different personality in every episode should have been enough for, like, six seasons, no?</p><h2 id=i-mean-why-does-she-ever-bother-with-clothes>I Mean, Why Does She Ever Bother With Clothes?</h2><p>Eliza Dushku has one of those bodies that makes me wonder why she ever wears clothes. Like, just walk around in underwear all day, girl! I would if I were you. Also, shout out to the tiny bit of white on her bra. Changing it up from her usually ALL black wardrobe, I guess. Honestly, I can’t think of any celebrity who wears as much black as Eliza Dushku.</p><p>Back to Eliza Dushku’s career, though. After Dollhouse, things went pretty quiet. Dushku made a few television appearances on The Big Bang Theory, White Collar, and The League. They were all one-episode appearances, though.</p><p>In 2013, Eliza Dushku started voicing She-Hulk on Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. The She-Hulk voice work is great, y’know for the fact that Dushku is still working and whatnot. Though, what’s up with her not being ON the screen? I need more of Eliza Dushku’s actual face on the actual TV. Thanks, Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=so-she-s-pretty-much-perfect>So, She's Pretty Much Perfect?</h2><p>Sure, Eliza Dushku’s bod may be complete and utter fire, but her face is equally as beautiful. Eliza Dushku is basically an all-round perfect person. I just don't have much more to say about this picture, because she's an actual perfect person.</p><p>Since there’s so much love for Eliza Dushku and Faith, why wasn’t the actress at Entertainment Weekly’s Buffy the Vampire Slayer reunion? GOOD QUESTION. Well, she wasn’t the only missing face. Anthony Head, who played Giles throughout the entire series, was also noticeably absent. However, Sarah Michelle Gellar confirmed Head was in England and unable to make the event. So, what about Eliza Dushku? Well, she tweeted a response in which she told fans that she wasn’t there because she wasn’t invited. SHE WASN’T INVITED! BRB, I'm dying right now. Entertainment Weekly, what have you done?!</p><p>There seems to be no bad blood, as Dushku explained that since she was never technically a regular cast member, she wasn’t invited. Um, I’m still kind of mad at Entertainment Weekly, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rocking-a-tank-top-and-jeans-better-than-anyone-else-ever>Rocking A Tank Top And Jeans Better Than Anyone Else Ever</h2><p>Wearing a tank top and jeans is how many fans will always remember Eliza Dushku. I don't know, I just feel like her characters usually wear a tank top and jeans, right? Well, that may be because Eliza Dushku looks so good in a tank top and jeans. In fact, is there anyone at all who wears a tank top and jeans better than Eliza Dushku? She’s up there with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Biel</a>, who can also rock a tank top and jeans like a pro.</p><p>Eliza Dushku’s whole life - personal and career - was taking a turn. Dushku had been dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick Fox</a>, LA Lakers player, since 2009. The pair then split in 2014. At that point, Eliza Dushku had been doing little work in Hollywood. Dushku then announced she had left LA, moved back to Boston, and was planning on attending Suffolk University.</p><p>I KNOW, GUYS.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seemed Eliza Dushku was saying goodbye to Hollywood. Say it ain’t so, right? Okay, it ain’t so. Eliza Dushku is getting her groove back in 2017. She announced she’s engaged to Peter Palandjian, a successful (read: rich) businessman. Dushku also announced a new project, which YAASS. It's about time, queen! Dushku will be starring in and producing the television adaptation of The Black Company,&nbsp;which is a dark fantasy that follows an elite mercenary group. Oh, so basically the perfect role for Eliza Dushku. She's back, y'all.</p><h2 id=umm-the-bring-it-one-car-wash-scene>Umm... The Bring It One Car Wash Scene</h2><p>Just in case you’ve never seen the classic that is Bring It On, which is the Citizen Kane of cheerleader movies in case you didn't know, the above photo is a great reason to pop it on. You know, because Eliza Dushku can rock a bikini. I mean, HELLO. Also, how much extra money did the producers have to pay her to get her to wear something other than a black bikini? I’m actually shocked to see her in something other than black.</p><p>Even in Bring It On, Dushku was playing the “bad girl,” which is something she’s certainly been typecast as and it's not hard to see why. Dushku has the bad girl look down perfectly. There is also a certain rebellious way in which she carries herself. On always playing the bad girl, Dushku explained, “It's easy to play a bad girl. You just do everything you've been told not to do, and you don't have to deal with the consequences, because it's only acting.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On that note, it’s totally true. Eliza Dushku gets to kill people while acting… but there’s no punishment.</p><h2 id=oh-and-this-is-what-she-looks-like-in-a-swimsuit-now>Oh, And This Is What She Looks Like In A Swimsuit Now</h2><p>It’s been 17 years since Bring It On, but Eliza Dushku’s body is just as flawless as it was then. Sure, she’s not rocking a teeny blue bikini anymore, but she honestly looks like she hasn’t aged a day since the late ‘90s and early 2000s. Also, this swimsuit is mostly black, because what else?</p><p>If you’re wanting to keep tabs on Eliza Dushku, Instagram or Twitter is the place to do so. Girlfriend is very active on social media. Particularly on her Instagram, where Eliza Dushku posts plenty of hot pictures like the above. So, go follow her. Now.</p><p>Also, social media is cool in that you can keep up with your favorite celebrities even when they aren’t doing much in the limelight. In the old days, if one of your stars wasn't in a television show or starring in a film, they were just out of the spotlight. Sure, you could buy a tabloid magazine to see pictures of them, but they were mostly inaccessible. Social media allows us to never lose contact with Eliza Dushku, which is awesome. Okay, now I sound like a weird stalker, which I swear I'm not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=one-of-her-last-public-appearances>One Of Her Last Public Appearances</h2><p>This is a photo of one of the last public appearances made by Eliza Dushku. And when I say "public appearance," I don’t mean Instagram post or paparazzi catching her shopping. I mean a Hollywood event. So, this was one of the latest Hollywood events Eliza Dushku attended and it was in APRIL 2016! APRIL 2016, GUYS!</p><p>Um, where is Eliza Dushku and why isn’t she invited to everything ever? Not only is she gorgeous, she seems like the type of person you want to come to your party, or film premiere, or awards show. I'll admit, I’m just imagining Eliza Dushku is Faith and, like, a total party starter, but still. She should get all the invites everywhere. Between the lack of public appearances and film or television roles, the world is being seriously deprived of Eliza Dushku.</p><p>Also, it feels weird to end this article with a photo of Eliza Dushku in WHITE overalls and a WHITE shirt. Has Eliza Dushku forsaken her black wardrobe? I’m so confused. I’m also so confused as to why Eliza Dushku has been MIA. Please help, Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: Bustle.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWawoJWnsm61zWaroZ1drLyzuMNmoKxllaG2u62MnaysoJuqenKBjKyrnpmdrnqxtcKtrKudo2LBsHnMmqKeZamkwm65yKyqZqCVp3w%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhere-in-the-world-is-eliza-dushku-15-steamy-pictures-to-make-you-miss-her.html&text=15%20Steamy%20Pictures%20To%20Make%20Us%20Miss%20Her&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-in-the-world-is-eliza-dushku-15-steamy-pictures-to-make-you-miss-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-in-the-world-is-eliza-dushku-15-steamy-pictures-to-make-you-miss-her.html&title=15%20Steamy%20Pictures%20To%20Make%20Us%20Miss%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhere-in-the-world-is-eliza-dushku-15-steamy-pictures-to-make-you-miss-her.html&title=15%20Steamy%20Pictures%20To%20Make%20Us%20Miss%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-in-the-world-is-eliza-dushku-15-steamy-pictures-to-make-you-miss-her.html&title=15%20Steamy%20Pictures%20To%20Make%20Us%20Miss%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-in-the-world-is-eliza-dushku-15-steamy-pictures-to-make-you-miss-her.html&description=15%20Steamy%20Pictures%20To%20Make%20Us%20Miss%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./american-music-awards-hottest-couples-on-the-red-carpet.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="American Music Awards: Hottest Couples on the Red Carpet">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./friends-most-memorable-celebrity-cameos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Most Memorable Celebrity Cameos On Friends, Officially Ranked">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
