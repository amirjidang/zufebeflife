They were also a reference to the band's&nbsp;2001 song titled "<strong>Kyle Quit the Band</strong>."&nbsp;The&nbsp;opening lyrics to the track&nbsp;are, "Last week/ Kyle quit the band/now we're back together, uh/misunderstanding," so it's clear to see how the tweet is alluding to the song.</p><p>But although the tweet was simply a prank, is there any truth to the lyrics of the song? Did Kyle Gass ever actually quit Tenacious D? Here's the truth behind "Kyle Quit the Band."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>How Jack Black Actually Inspired The Creation Of 'School Of Rock'</a></span></p><h2 id=how-jack-black-met-kyle-gass><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>How&nbsp;Jack Black Met Kyle Gass</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tenacious D&nbsp;was founded in 1994 by actors and musicians Jack Black and Kyle Gass.&nbsp;In those days, Black had yet to become <a href=#>the world-famous actor</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>social media star</a> he is today, and Gass had only played small roles in two Hollywood movies. The two met in the 1980s while they were both members of The Actor's Gang, an esteemed Los Angeles theatre troupe. Black was still a teenager at the time, while Gass was in his late twenties.</p><h2 id=black-and-gass-didn-t-get-along-at-first><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Black and Gass Didn't Get Along at First</span></h2><p>Although their friendship and musical partnership has lasted for more than twenty-five years,&nbsp;Jack Black and Kyle Gass didn't immediately get along with one another when they first met. In <a href=#>an interview with the&nbsp;</a><a href=#>San Francisco Chronicle</a>,&nbsp;Gass said "We were not instant friends." However, the two bonded as they began to work on music together. In the same interview, Black said, "We&nbsp;eventually realized if we joined forces, we could be an indestructible force of entertainment."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Tenacious D’s Jack Black & Kyle Gass Say Trump Inspired Their NSFW Graphic Novel</a></span></p><h2 id=gass-taught-black-some-very-important-lessons><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gass Taught Black Some Very Important Lessons</span></h2><p>Jack Black wasn't really a musician before he met Kyle Gass. In fact, it was Gass who taught&nbsp;Black how to play the guitar, which <a href=#>the two revealed on an episode of&nbsp;</a><a href=#>Late Night with Conan O'Brien</a>.&nbsp;So while Jack Black may have become the more successful of the two, he will always owe a debt of gratitude to Gass for the music lessons.</p><h2 id=tenacious-d-s-big-break><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Tenacious D's Big Break</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tenacious D gave their first official&nbsp;performance at Al's Bar in 1994, where <a href=#>actor and comedian David Cross heard them play and invited them to open for his live comedy show&nbsp;</a>Mr. Show,&nbsp;Black and Gass told Kerrang! magazine. A year later, Jack Black would be cast as a featured performer on the television version of&nbsp;Mr. Show.&nbsp;Perhaps it bothered Gass that Black was beginning to see more and more success as an actor while he was still struggling to land roles, but that never led Gass to quit the band.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Inside David Cross And Amber Tamblyn Quiet Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=the-first-demo-tape><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The First&nbsp;Demo Tape</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After performing in various venues around Los Angeles for several years, Tenacious D self-produced their first demo tape. The demo tape featured four songs:&nbsp;"Tribute,"&nbsp;"Krishna," "History," and&nbsp;"Kyle Quit the Band." So as it turns out, "Kyle Quit the Band" was actually one the group's earliest songs.</p><h2 id=the-story-behind-kyle-quit-the-band><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Story Behind "Kyle Quit the Band"</span></h2><p>There is no reason to believe that&nbsp;"Kyle Quit the Band" is anything other than a funny song. As Jack Black told Kerrang!,&nbsp;he and Gass "write song titles before the actual songs" and that they try to come up with song titles that "would make you want to listen." It seems like the duo just decided that "Kyle Quit the Band"&nbsp;was a great idea for a song.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Jack Black's Tenacious D Graphic Novel KKK Video Confuses Fans</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kyle-quit-the-band-live><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>"Kyle Quit the Band" Live</span></h2><p>The duo is notable for including comedy sketches on their albums and in their concerts, and <a href=#>sometimes they will perform a sketch where Black and Gass get into a fight onstage and Gass storms off, pretending to have quit the band</a>. After that, Black will perform his solo number&nbsp;"Dude (I Totally Miss You)" only to have Gass return shortly thereafter to rejoin&nbsp;band.</p><h2 id=kyle-s-other-bands><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kyle's Other Bands</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kyle Gass never actually quit Tenacious D, and the band has now been performing together for twenty-seven&nbsp;years.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;the band has gone on several long hiatuses, often&nbsp;because of Jack Black's busy schedule as a Hollywood star.&nbsp;For this reason, Gass has formed two other bands without Black, called Trainwreck and The Kyle Gass Band. However, even&nbsp;though Gass has two other bands, he remains a member of Tenacious D to this day.</p><h2 id=recent-projects><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Recent Projects</span></h2><p>Tenacious D is still together, and there are no signs that they're planning to break up any time soon. In 2020, <a href=#>Jack Black and Kyle Gass wrote a graphic novel together</a>, which was inspired by their fourth studio album&nbsp;Post-Apocalypto&nbsp;from 2018. Their most recent project was a mashup&nbsp;of two songs by The Beatles, which they released as a charity single for Doctors Without Borders.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Ryan Gosling & 9 Other Actors You Forgot Were Once In A Band</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoMatsYygmKyrXZrDpr6MmpqtrZGhubp50K6grWWkmruir8iorKxllGQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-kyle-gass-ever-actually-quit-tenacious-d.html&text=Did%20Kyle%20Gass%20Ever%20Actually%20Quit%20Tenacious%20D%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-kyle-gass-ever-actually-quit-tenacious-d.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-kyle-gass-ever-actually-quit-tenacious-d.html&title=Did%20Kyle%20Gass%20Ever%20Actually%20Quit%20Tenacious%20D%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-kyle-gass-ever-actually-quit-tenacious-d.html&title=Did%20Kyle%20Gass%20Ever%20Actually%20Quit%20Tenacious%20D%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-kyle-gass-ever-actually-quit-tenacious-d.html&title=Did%20Kyle%20Gass%20Ever%20Actually%20Quit%20Tenacious%20D%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-kyle-gass-ever-actually-quit-tenacious-d.html&description=Did%20Kyle%20Gass%20Ever%20Actually%20Quit%20Tenacious%20D%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./roger-bonds-diddy-former-head-of-security-cassie-lawsuit-statement-1234823220.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diddy's Former Head of Security Breaks Silence On Cassie's Lawsuit">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./darren-waller-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Darren Waller Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
