In 2021, he built a church in his hometown, Guayacanes, Dominican Republic. According to the pitcher, he had promised to build his friend, Pastor Antonio, a new church when he reached the majors. The construction cost around 2 million Dominican Pesos (around USD 100,000) of his own money on the 1,500-square-foot structure with fifty rooms.</p><p>The standout pitcher for the Houston Astros has unequivocally established himself as one of the American League’s most dominant pitchers. And many around him are noticing his poor form. However, his fans believe Valdez could return to his best days soon.</p><p>At age 21, Framber was the oldest amateur free agent signing from his country by five years. After a hard day, two Astros scouts recognized him after viewing programs run by independent trainers.

His wife, a Dominican, has accompanied the baseball pitcher throughout his struggle days. Even though Valdez speaks less about his wife, we know he has received great mental support from his partner during his playing time.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, Isamal also accompanies her husband during awards and events. The duo was most recently present at L.A. Live’s All-Star Red Carpet Show on July 19, 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Isamal has never used her husband’s name, fame, or riches to further her profession, even if he is the finest. Although she cares for her children at home, little is known about her education, family, or siblings. She seems to have quit her job to follow her husband’s MBL ambition.</p><h2 id=framber-valdez-has-three-kids-with-his-wife><span class=ez-toc-section id=framber-valdez-has-three-kids-with-his-wife></span> Framber Valdez Has Three Kids With His Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Framber Valdez is the proud father of three children.

Due to his dread of flying, Valdez had previously avoided traveling to see him perform.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jose Antonio has described his son. Framber is the “primary cornerstone” of the household.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Valdez recently dedicated his Game 2 of the World Series 5-2 victory over the Phillies to his parents. The pitcher said, as quoted on&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Our Esquina</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, “I feel very blessed to have my father here, even to the point he did not want to come at first because he was afraid of flying, My mom, that’s a different thing too. It’s her second year here. She doesn’t mind flying.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He continued: “But, yeah, to have my father here gives me a little of extra power. Especially because he’s used to just seeing me pitch on T.V., seeing guys like (Jose) Altuve, (Alex) Bregman, (Jeremy) Peña on T.V. Now he is able to see them in person. It means a lot. And, yeah, it means the world to me that he’s here, that they’re both here.”</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=m-0><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-framber-valdez-wife-isamal-valdez></span>Who Framber Valdez wife Isamal Valdez?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Framber Valdez’s gorgeous wife is Isamal Valdez, and the couple has been tied in the knot since 2000.<h3 class=m-0><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-framber-valdezs-net-worth-and-salary></span>What is Framber Valdez’s net worth and salary?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Framber Valdez earns a USD 3,000,000 yearly compensation on average.
