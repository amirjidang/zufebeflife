We love her and think she would be the perfect BFF. She is smart, talented, fun, humble, and very successful. All traits that a good BFF should have. Emma Stone has been in many films that prove she is BFF material. From the movies Easy A to Superbad and Zombieland, she proves she is quick, smart, and has a great personality.</p><p>With over 30 awards and having starred in a Broadway musical, there would never be a dull moment with her. Here are 10 reasons why we want her to be our BFF.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Emma Stone Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><h2 id=she-s-hot>She’s HOT</h2><p>Emma Stone is incredibly gorgeous, and that's not an understatement. Easy A, Zombieland, and Superbad are just a few of the movies that Emma Stone is amazing in and inspired millions by.</p><p>Emma Stone is just as kick-butt-hot in those movies as she is in real life. She looks amazing in all of her awards photos, we can't believe they aren't movies! Emma Stone seems to be made for the camera, or the camera was made for her. Either way, we want to be friends with her just to know how she does it. So far, our best guess is pure natural talent or magic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things Emma Stone Has Bought</a></span></p><h2 id=she-knows-spider-man>She Knows Spider-Man</h2><p>Gwen Stacy is played by Emma Stone in the <a href=#><i>Spider-Man </i></a>series. This is great because, ok, not only does she know Spider-Man, she's one of the few people that do. It's like an exclusive club of people that know Peter Parker, the man behind the suit. Knowing Spider-Man must have its perks.</p><p>For instance, going to the coffee shop in busy traffic must only take minutes swinging from buildings. But not only that, she has a relationship with him, and that's the ultimate in the zone. It's almost a two for one because we want to be friends with Emma Stone, we seriously do love you, but we get a Spider-Man club pass with that, right?</p><h2 id=have-you-seen-her-house>Have You SEEN Her House?</h2><p>Having a friend that has a house you can go to for just hanging out is important. We always try and go to the nicest house we can right? Have you seen Emma Stone's house?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The beautiful $2.5 million dollar house is gigantic and looks pristine. Complete with a pool and backyard, the house is perfect for any hang out session. We want to go there and eat dinner and go swimming. Emma Stone seems like the perfect person, in our opinion, to spend a whole day with at her house and bake cookies or watch one of her films and enjoy every moment of it!</p><h2 id=we-want-to-see-her-awards-all-of-them>We Want To See Her Awards. ALL OF THEM!</h2><p>Ms. Stone is an amazing actress and humanitarian. Every year she is leading by example and doing good things for the world. In 2017 she won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in <i>La La Land </i>in which she stared with Ryan Gosling, making it a total of 31 awards.</p><p>Having trophies and awards is great, and is a huge social boost and page-turner on a resume. She certainly deserves them. To have a friend with that many awards would amazing and extremely interesting to sit and listen to her talk about each one and how it came about.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Oscar Dresses Of All Time</a></span></p><h2 id=she-kicks-butt>She Kicks Butt</h2><p>Every once in a while someone has to kick some butt. That's when its time to call your toughest friend for backup. Emma Stone isn't a 300-pound linebacker, but she kicks major booty. In <i>Battle of the Sexes </i>with Steve Carell, she portrays the real-life Billie Jean King who was a #1 rated professional <a href=#>tennis player</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She historically plays a tennis match against previous #1 rated misogynist Bobby Riggs, who had claimed that a woman couldn’t beat him. This is a major role for anyone, it takes guts to stand up for what's right and cement important events into history. They were both nominated for Golden Globes for their portrayals.</p><h2 id=she-s-genuine>She’s Genuine</h2><p>Being genuine is rare in Hollywood, many actors pretend to be something they aren't or can't be. Emma Stone is one of those rare genuine people that is totally just like some of the characters she portrays. In Superbad Emma Stone portrayed a character named Jules. Jules is the knockout high school girl character, and instead of being perky and funny, Emma Stone brought genuine honesty to the movie with her cool, calm comebacks and smooth response lines.</p><p>This is similar to her own genuine self and she showed it in her work. Being genuine is an amazing feature to have and it seems natural to her.</p><h2 id=she-s-humble>She’s Humble</h2><p>Humility is important when working on your career and dealing with people. Emma Stone doesn't make a scene or brag about her accomplishments, and rarely starts conflicts with media or managers. This is one of her amazing talents, being so smooth and workable, as well as honest and humble.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She isn't afraid to say the truth or to do what she thinks is right. Humility is powerful, and being famous doesn't excuse a person from being humble. Emma Stone shows that she can be successful and humble with her honesty in interviews and her genuine nature on-screen and off-screen, without forcing answers or leaving out any information.</p><h2 id=she-s-fun>She’s Fun</h2><p>Having a good time is so important in any workplace. Emma Stone shows that she loves to have fun. She's always making the best of situations and finding a reason to laugh or smile. In interviews, she avoids serious topics and tries to tell truthful entertaining stories instead of bore everyone with random facts or try to convince people of anything.</p><p>Emma knows how to have fun in any situation, her honesty really lets people know she's genuinely enjoying herself. When she is asked tough questions she doesn't ever overthink them, the answer is always something comforting, relatable, or laughable.</p><h2 id=she-s-smart>She’s Smart</h2><p>Smart people seize the moment and this trait helps them become successful. Emma Stone realized that she could be herself in movies and it was magical. With over 30 awards for acting, Emma Stone found her talent and strengthened it. Intelligence is a skill that needs training and Emma Stone is not afraid to train.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She sang on Broadway and used her actual voice for many songs in several movies. The talent and training required for that, along with the courage and getting the director on board is a very intelligent idea. This makes her one of our favorite people for reaching out and expanding and using her skills.</p><h2 id=she-s-honest>She’s Honest</h2><p>Honesty is important in friendship and shows character. We love it when someone is honest because it shows they care and they are open to sharing things with us. Emma Stone is beautifully honest and open to everyone, which is especially great for a BFF.</p><p>When filming <a href=#><i>Zombieland: Double Tap</i></a>, Emma Stone shared that the fake vomit made her want to actually vomit, which is something most stars wouldn't admit to, even if asked that specific question. This is the type of honesty and clear communication that is totally amazing for someone who is under the microscope and in front of the cameras.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Reasons We Want Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson To Be Our BFF</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nlaK6onnSraannV2XsrTAjJ%2Bpop2emXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2femma-stone-best-friend.html&text=10%20Reasons%20We%20Want%20Emma%20Stone%20To%20Be%20Our%20BFF&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2femma-stone-best-friend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2femma-stone-best-friend.html&title=10%20Reasons%20We%20Want%20Emma%20Stone%20To%20Be%20Our%20BFF" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2femma-stone-best-friend.html&title=10%20Reasons%20We%20Want%20Emma%20Stone%20To%20Be%20Our%20BFF" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2femma-stone-best-friend.html&title=10%20Reasons%20We%20Want%20Emma%20Stone%20To%20Be%20Our%20BFF" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2femma-stone-best-friend.html&description=10%20Reasons%20We%20Want%20Emma%20Stone%20To%20Be%20Our%20BFF" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10-songwriters-you-didnt-know-wrote-pop-musics-biggest-hits.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Songwriters You Didnt Know Wrote Pop Musics Biggest Hits">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-of-the-worst-celebrity-trainwrecks-of-all-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 of the Worst Celebrity Trainwrecks of All Time">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
