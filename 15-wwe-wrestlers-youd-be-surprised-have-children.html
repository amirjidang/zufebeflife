They travel all around the world typically working four-to-five nights per week putting their body on the line every time. The lack of time at home has caused many to put off starting a family. <a href=#>John Cena</a> specifically stated he doesn’t want to have a child while he is working full-time for WWE. Despite the sacrifices, many do it to support a good lifestyle for their families. A few stories of wrestlers being parents have been documented.</p><p>Kevin Owens often references his two young children being the reason for doing whatever it takes to thrive in WWE. It sparked his prizefighter persona having a ruthless mentality but showed honorable intentions for a multi-faceted character. There are a few wrestlers working for WWE that have a family life at home but most fans aren’t aware of it. Many of the wrestlers don’t discuss their private life, some are rather young to be parents and others just don’t seem like they would be mothers or fathers. We’ll break down all of them here with a look at fifteen current WWE wrestlers you wouldn’t expect to have children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-jimmy-uso><strong>15. </strong><strong>Jimmy Uso</strong></h2><p>The Uso brothers are one of the cornerstones of the Smackdown tag team division. WWE has valued <a href=#>Jimmy Uso</a> and <a href=#>Jey Uso</a> among their best teams for many years. As fraternal twins, the Usos work perfectly together and fans sometimes confuse them due to it. Total Divas has helped separate their identities. Jimmy Uso is married to <a href=#>Naomi</a> and their personal life together has been one of the more entertaining aspects of the show.</p><p>Naomi has become the stepmother to both Jimmy’s children from a prior relationship. Jimmy has two kids named Jaidenn and Jayla that were shown on the reality show. Naomi brought a traveling petting zoo to the household in hopes of winning over the new stepchildren in a memorable episode. Jimmy is the son of the highly respected former WWE star Rikishi and you have to wonder if the family tradition will continue on in the next generation.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-kofi-kingston><strong>14. </strong><strong>Kofi Kingston</strong></h2><p>Another wrestler that has been involved in the WWE world for a long time is Kofi Kingston. The company has viewed Kingston as one of the most loyal and hardworking employees on the roster. Kofi struggled for many years to find a relevant spot on the roster. That all changed when Kingston aligned with Big E and Xavier Woods to form the New Day. Life is great for Kingston having the time of his career and using the newfound popularity to make a great living for his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kingston is a family man in his home life as a devoted husband and father. New Day made note of it in comical fashion when opponent Titus O’Neil was named Father of the Year in a publication. They carried a sign to the ring stating Kofi was the true dad of the year. Kingston has two sons and is regarded as a great father by all accounts. One of his kids appeared on an episode of Total Divas visiting Natalya and TJ Wilson.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-heath-slater><strong>13. Heath Slater</strong></h2><p>Heath Slater makes the list despite his official WWE t-shirt literally being about having children. The character of Slater has reached new highs in WWE following his plea for a job on Raw and Smackdown as a comical free agent. Slater exaggerating the number of children he needs to take care provided great entertainment and landed him a Smackdown Tag Team Championship run with Rhyno. The comedy involved with Slater’s “I Got Kids” t-shirt on WWE Shop has led to many wondering if he actually has kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>WWE’s newest cult hero is indeed a father. Slater has two children with his wife and lives in Florida together as a happy family. Sorry to break kayfabe, but he does not have seven children that reside in a trailer park. Still, you have to feel good for Slater getting his biggest singles push in WWE and earning more money to take care of his kids. The silly storyline on television is actually paralleling a very real but wonderful thing to come from his rise in popularity.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-r-truth><strong>12. R-Truth</strong></h2><p>The veteran locker room presence of R-Truth has landed him a position in WWE for the past few years. One good thing for Truth is the fact that he looks like he never ages. R-Truth moves around the ring well and physically looks very young despite nearing his 45th birthday. The tag team of Truth and <a href=#>Goldust</a> are one of the more entertaining house show acts that keep the young audience satisfied with the silliness of pro wrestling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>R-Truth likely connects well with the younger audience due to the fact that he has many children of his own. The wrestling veteran is a veteran of fatherhood with five children all with drastic age differences. WWE Network’s Table for 3 saw Truth revealed he had his oldest child is already an adult and his youngest child was born in 2014. Between the wrestling and rap careers, Truth has been a father for his entire adult life.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-tamina><strong>11. Tamina</strong></h2><p>Tamina is one of the rare WWE female wrestlers to have children at home. The more common story in wrestling has seen the fathers continue to work on the road, but the mothers frequently retire from in-ring competition for a few years. Tamina has struggled to get consistent television in WWE but has held down a main roster spot for the past six years. The only things really discussed about the mysterious Tamina are her being the daughter of Jimmy Snuka and a relative to <a href=#>The Rock</a> and <a href=#>Roman Reigns</a>.</p><p>A surprising fact about Tamina is the fact that she has been a mother for quite some time now. Tamina had a marriage early in her life that unfortunately ended with divorce in 2003. The good things to come from the marriage were Tamina giving birth to a pair of daughters. Milaneta and Maleata are the daughters of Tamina and she is likely motivated by them to come back to WWE TV stronger than ever following injury.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-bobby-roode><strong>10. </strong><strong>Bobby Roode</strong></h2><p>The newest superstar in NXT is actually one of the older wrestlers signed by WWE. <a href=#>Triple H</a> signed former TNA main event star Bobby Roode to help add roster depth in NXT. The fans have already made it a home run with their treating Roode like one of the biggest stars on the show. Roode’s “Glorious” theme song and entrance set him apart from the rest of the roster as possibly a future WWE star.</p><p>Despite his new presence in WWE’s developmental and a physical look suggesting otherwise, Roode will turn 40 years old on the first day of 2017. Roode has remained married throughout his TNA career into the WWE deal. The couple has three sons that have to be thrilled to see their dad become a big deal in WWE. Robert III, Riley, and Nicholas are the motivation for Roode wanting to continue making a living in the business, and he has to be content with his decision to leave TNA.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-jack-swagger><strong>9. </strong><strong>Jack Swagger</strong></h2><p>Jack Swagger has transitioned into a midcarder on Smackdown after struggling to get television time on Raw. WWE once viewed as future main event star due to his tremendous athletic ability. Swagger unfortunately couldn’t connect to the audience and spent the majority of his career in obscurity. Rumors circulated that he would consider leaving WWE in the past year when his contract ended to try his luck in the world of mixed martial arts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The stability of WWE likely appealed to Swagger knowing he’d be able to make enough money to take care of his family. Swagger is married to model Catalina White and the couple already has two children. Their first child Knox Sterling was born in 2011. Knox would welcome a baby sister in 2015 when Swagger and White welcomed daughter Presley Pearl into the world. Swagger is not viewed as the likely choice to already have two kids, but his home life is all about family.</p><p></p><h2></h2><h2 id=8-randy-orton><strong>8. Randy Orton</strong></h2><p>WWE has showcased <a href=#>Randy Orton</a> on television for the past thirteen years as one of the faces of the company. Orton has done many great things but has also caused a great deal of disappointment during his various pushes. Many of Orton’s issues came from being an immature person not yet capable of having a top spot in WWE. The growing process of Orton taking along with his brash personality makes it unclear if he’d be the kind of person to have children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Orton actually is already a father with the birth of his first child Alanna coming during his marriage to ex-wife Samantha. The current personal life of Orton sees him married to Kimberly Kessler. Orton’s wife has three children from a past marriage as well and Orton serves as a stepfather to them. Kessler is currently pregnant and the happy couple is slated to have their next child born in a few months.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-karl-anderson><strong>7. </strong><strong>Karl Anderson</strong></h2><p>The signing of Karl Anderson by the WWE made big news early in 2016. Anderson has been one of the top stars for New Japan over the past eight years. No one wanted to take the chance on him in the United States, so he took the risk of moving to Japan and it paid off. WWE signed him and Luke Gallows to continue their NJPW tag team in their commitment to aggressively pursuit the top free agents in the wrestling world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anderson frequently mentions his “hot Asian wife” on television and on the internet. Everyone knows he’s married, but Anderson also has two children. The well respected in-ring technician made a drastic decision to leave Japan after becoming a highly valued member of the roster. Anderson having three children and making his home in the United States likely impacted the choice to wrestle for WWE. We’ll likely see Anderson in WWE for quite some time and his kids have to be happy about it.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-curtis-axel><strong>6. Curtis Axel</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Curtis Axel</a> is mostly known for two things in the wrestling world. The good thing is his ties to a legend as the son of the late great Mr. Perfect. The less wonderful impact is his reputation of being nothing more than a glorified enhancement talent. WWE tried to utilize Axel in a few different roles, but he struggled to ever over as a singles star. A bland personality and lackluster in-ring presence have each made Axel one of the lower tier wrestlers currently in WWE.</p><p>Despite the struggles to succeed in WWE, Axel continues to work hard and show faith in things eventually turning him around. Axel is now a father and will most likely want his sons to create a fourth generation of wrestlers in the industry. The unique names have been handed out by Axel naming his three boys Hoss, Blade and Brock Hennig. All of them already have names perfect for wrestling. Say what you want about Axel’s talent, but you can’t question his love for wrestling and commitment to his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-roman-reigns><strong>5. Roman Reigns</strong></h2><p>The young WWE career of <a href=#>Roman Reigns</a> has already seen him accomplish more than the majority of wrestlers will ever get to achieve. Reigns has main event the prior two WrestleMania events with three WWE World Championship reigns. A polarizing reaction has made Reigns among the most controversial figures in the business. Many fans view him as the top guy while an equally strong sect of the audience root against him.</p><p>One person that is always supporting Reigns is his young daughter. Roman is only 31 years old and one of the younger main eventers today, but he already has a family life. The wrestling star married his significant other Galina back in 2014. Reigns has an 8-year-old daughter named Joelle and the two were featured in a WWE PSA about parenthood. A large percentage of wrestling fans have disdain for Reigns being dubbed “the guy” but everyone has to support his commitment to his daughter.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-erick-rowan><strong>4. </strong><strong>Erick Rowan</strong></h2><p>The Wyatt Family coming to WWE has given us a great faction. Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper and Erick Rowan all work well together. Despite being around for a few years now, all three members of the group have an aura of mystery behind them. We at least know about the backgrounds of Harper and Wyatt. Rowan is relatively unknown when it comes to his personal life. Hopefully he doesn’t wear the sheep mask in everyday life to scare others as he is actually a family man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rowan has a wife and two children. As the father of a boy and girl, Rowan likely has a hectic life between the gruelling WWE schedule and having to take care of two young kids at home. Very few were aware of Rowan being a father until a family holiday photo of him with wife and kids circulated on the internet. You have to appreciate Rowan being one of the last wrestlers to keep his personal life private until a photo finally surfaced.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-cedric-alexander><strong>3. Cedric Alexander</strong></h2><p>WWE’s cruiserweight division has led to the company going after many of the top independent wrestling stars. Cedric Alexander cut a lot of weight to qualify for the Cruiserweight Classic and it paid off big time. Many believe Alexander stood out more than the rest of the field and it resulted in him earning a contract. The Raw Cruiserweight division is in its early stages with Alexander being one of the better talents to perform so far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alexander is among the youngest stars on the WWE roster at just 27 years old. That makes it a bit surprising to realize he’s a father. Alexander has a 2-year-old daughter and his work in getting to WWE was definitely motivated by that. Wrestlers with children have more incentive to make it to the top than the average performer without a family. There are so few places to make great money in wrestling. Alexander is hoping to make an impact on Raw and prove he’s one of the best in the world.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-brock-lesnar><strong>2. Brock Lesnar</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Brock Lesnar</a> is making huge money for WWE to wrestle a part-time schedule due to his drawing power as an attraction. The prior stint in WWE made Lesnar hate the traveling aspect of the wrestling business. With more leverage in his current run, Lesnar demanded a part-time schedule that only sees him wrestle a handful of times per year. The secluded life of Brock sees him have his own farm in Saskatchewan, Canada.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lesnar lives his very private life with his wife Sable and their children. The two met during Lesnar’s first WWE stint in 2003. Brock and Sable have two sons together with the aptly named Turk and Duke. Lesnar also has another two kids from a prior marriage. It is almost impossible to envision Lesnar as a nurturing and loving father, but he does have four kids so he clearly enjoys being a dad. The fact that he chooses to spend the majority of his time at home rather than trying to make extra money by wrestling more means Lesnar has to be fond of the dad life.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-bray-wyatt><strong>1. Bray Wyatt</strong></h2><p>Very few wrestlers carry the intrigue and mystery as Bray Wyatt does. WWE has their own thinking man’s heel with the hopes of him becoming a big part of the future. Wyatt made an impact on the main roster introducing his peculiar gimmick as the leader of The Wyatt Family. The acting work done by Wyatt for his character is amazing, and most would find it hard to believe he has a normal life outside of the ring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wyatt did his best to keep the character going by refusing to break kayfabe for a few years. Unfortunately for him, everything gets leaked eventually and it was revealed Bray is actually a family man. Aside from the Wyatt Family, he is the leader of Rotunda household. Wyatt is married to his wife Samantha and the couple has a pair of kids. Kendyl and Cayden are the loves of Bray’s life. Good luck continuing to view Wyatt as The Eater of Worlds after realizing he is a loving husband and the father of two adorable kids when he’s not on WWE television.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong><a href=#>TheSportster</a>, <a href=#>Reddit</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZmptXazEpnnWq5ysrJyav7R52KisnWWSmnq0wdGpqaKrlZl6qa3VnmScoJmhsbOxzWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-wwe-wrestlers-youd-be-surprised-have-children.html&text=15%20WWE%20Wrestlers%20You%27d%20Be%20Surprised%20Have%20Children&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-wwe-wrestlers-youd-be-surprised-have-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-wwe-wrestlers-youd-be-surprised-have-children.html&title=15%20WWE%20Wrestlers%20You%27d%20Be%20Surprised%20Have%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-wwe-wrestlers-youd-be-surprised-have-children.html&title=15%20WWE%20Wrestlers%20You%27d%20Be%20Surprised%20Have%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-wwe-wrestlers-youd-be-surprised-have-children.html&title=15%20WWE%20Wrestlers%20You%27d%20Be%20Surprised%20Have%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-wwe-wrestlers-youd-be-surprised-have-children.html&description=15%20WWE%20Wrestlers%20You%27d%20Be%20Surprised%20Have%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./abigail-breslin-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Abigail Breslin Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./15-things-you-didnt-know-about-hugh-hefners-girls-next-door.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Things You Didn't Know About Hugh Hefner's Girls Next Door">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
