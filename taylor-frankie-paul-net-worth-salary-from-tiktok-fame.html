Since joining <strong><a href=#>Tik Tok</a></strong> and other platforms, she has garnered almost 5 million followers, 4 million of which are on Tik Tok alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paul made a name for herself as a wholesome influencer, a "mommy blogger" of sorts, by posting cute and endearing videos of her children, fitness tips, parenting advice, makeup tutorials, and your standard "Get Ready With Me" videos. Paul, who is a Mormon (<a href=#>as are several other celebrities</a>), first blew up when she opened up on a Tik Tok live about her divorce from her husband, Tate Paul, after experimenting with a semi-open relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Stars That People Forget Have Ties To Mormonism</a></span></p><p>But a recent domestic violence incident could damage the influencer and Utah resident's reputation and with it her wealth. Stories about the influencer's private life have not been as wholesome as her videos. But even if her scandals do damage her finances, the question still needs to be answered, how much is Taylor Frankie Paul worth thanks to her Tik Tok fame?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-taylor-frankie-paul-become-famous>How Did Taylor Frankie Paul Become Famous?</h2><p>Paul's two children with her ex-husband Tate were born in 2017 and 2020, respectively. Paul grew her Tik Tok following slowly but surely with your standard fitness influencer and mommy blogger types of videos, as many other TikTokers have done.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/untitled-design-26.jpg><p>In 2022, she blew up the internet when she revealed that she and Tate Paul were officially splitting up. She also revealed that the couple had been experimenting with a semi-open relationship and "soft swinging" before Tate Paul filed for a divorce.</p><p>Soft swinging is a form of swinging where couples engage in sex acts in the same room as other couples, but do not switch or trade partners. Paul opened up about the experience, sharing the positives and negatives, and made herself vulnerable to harsh criticism.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The news was a sensational moment for the influencer, many of her fans on "MomTok" were shocked, even offended by her confession, but the incident did not damage her follower count, nor her reputation very much. Paul already had a respectable online presence, but her confessional turned her into the Tik Tok celebrity she is now, AKA the "Mormon Soft Swinger." As such, Paul has been able to build a respectable net worth with her content creation.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-taylor-frankie-paul-worth>How Much Is Taylor Frankie Paul Worth?</h2><p>Since blowing up on Tik Tok, Taylor Frankie Paul has gotten all the kinds of deals one would expect an influencer would get. From modeling jobs to branded content, and most likely a sizable payout from the Tik Tok creator fund, Paul allegedly makes a healthy living doing what she does.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/untitled-design-4-4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the exact figures are unknown, sources indicate that Paul is worth anywhere between $1 million and $3 million. Her annual income is unknown <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but most likely varies from year to year.</a></p><p>Also, little is known about Paul's past. Her upbringing, educational background, family life, and other details remain minimal and hard to find. Whether Paul was raised a Mormon or converted to Mormonism later in life is also unknown. The Mormon church has strict rules about marriage, the place of women in the family, and above all sex and sexuality, hence the reason why her soft-swinging confession was so sensational.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Willow Smith & Other Celebrities Who Have Been In Polyamorous/Open Relationships</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What is known is that Paul soon started a new relationship after breaking up with Tate Paul. Taylor Frankie Paul began dating a man named Dakota Mortensen, but the pair broke up after six months <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when Paul suffered an ectopic pregnancy</a>. According to The Daily Mail, Paul feels this breakup was harder than what she endured after Tate Paul and her broke up over the soft-swinging scandal.</p><p>Although the soft-swinging story, did little damage to Paul's popularity, allegations that arose in early 2023 might stain her image for good, and put a dent in that $3 million net worth.</p><h2 id=have-the-allegations-affected-frankie-taylor-paul-39-s-net-worth>Have The Allegations Affected Frankie Taylor Paul's Net Worth?</h2><p>"What allegations?" One might be thinking. Well, in late February 2023, approximately a year after her soft swinging confessional and a month after her break up with Mortensen, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Frankie Taylor Paul was arrested</a>.</p><p>The charges? Misdemeanor assault, criminal mischief, and one charge that is possibly the most damaging to her image and her reputation. Taylor Frankie Paul was also charged with some rather troubling crimes that her children allegedly witnessed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/untitled-design-3-4.jpg><p>Before admitting to soft swinging, Paul's image was built around her wholesome reputation as a loving and dotting mother. Her children Indy and Ocean Paul are in several of her videos, including her instructional parenting videos, like how to properly burp a baby.</p><p>So it only makes matters worse that the Herrimin Police Department, who responded to the domestic violence call, allegedly have video evidence that Paul's actions. These actions may have caused harm to the people a mother treasures most in the world. The harm was most likely not intentional, as the children were not Paul's targets, according to police reports.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Travis Barker’s Daughter Calls Cops To Break Up Mom’s Domestic Dispute</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to KSLTV, Salt Lake City's NBC affiliate, Paul returned home intoxicated on February 17th, 2023, where an argument with a current partner (name unknown) escalated quickly. Police reportedly could hear screaming inside the house and entered. When the alleged victim began to speak to officers, Paul "lunged" at them, according to the police department's probable cause report.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-taylor-frankie-paul-after-her-scandal>What Happened To Taylor Frankie Paul After Her Scandal?</h2><p>The incident could result in felony assault charges being levied against Paul. Additional charges of other crimes might be added to the case upon further investigation according to the Salt Lake County District Attorney's office.</p><p>Until the case is concluded or dismissed, Paul will have a lot of legal matters to navigate. But what about her money and her reputation? Can Taylor Frankie Paul survive this scandal? And what will become of little Ocean and Indy? Only time will tell...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9ustGapaShlWK9osHLZqWerF2svLPAx2aqmqSRp8ZustGopGasmaDBsLeMn5imnV8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-frankie-paul-net-worth-salary-from-tiktok-fame.html&text=Did%20Taylor%20Frankie%20Paul%20Make%20Nearly%20As%20Much%20From%20Her%20TikTok%20Fame%20As%20Fans%20Might%20Think%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-frankie-paul-net-worth-salary-from-tiktok-fame.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-frankie-paul-net-worth-salary-from-tiktok-fame.html&title=Did%20Taylor%20Frankie%20Paul%20Make%20Nearly%20As%20Much%20From%20Her%20TikTok%20Fame%20As%20Fans%20Might%20Think%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-frankie-paul-net-worth-salary-from-tiktok-fame.html&title=Did%20Taylor%20Frankie%20Paul%20Make%20Nearly%20As%20Much%20From%20Her%20TikTok%20Fame%20As%20Fans%20Might%20Think%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-frankie-paul-net-worth-salary-from-tiktok-fame.html&title=Did%20Taylor%20Frankie%20Paul%20Make%20Nearly%20As%20Much%20From%20Her%20TikTok%20Fame%20As%20Fans%20Might%20Think%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-frankie-paul-net-worth-salary-from-tiktok-fame.html&description=Did%20Taylor%20Frankie%20Paul%20Make%20Nearly%20As%20Much%20From%20Her%20TikTok%20Fame%20As%20Fans%20Might%20Think%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dina-denoire.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dina Denoire Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Info, Details, Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jonathan-taylor-thomas-home-improvement-cast-relationship-when-he-became-teen-heartthrob.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Jonathan Taylor Thomas' Home Improvement Co-Stars Treat Him Differently When He Became A Teen He">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
