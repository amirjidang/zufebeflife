Studios were eyeing her for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top-billed roles in movies like&nbsp;Justice League</a>&nbsp;and Her, and now she's the face of Lois Lane in the DCEU. What fans don't know is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adams almost became a part of the Power Rangers universe</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to entertainment writer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric Francisco</a>, Adams originally got the part to play the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pink Lightspeed Ranger in the Power Rangers' eighth season</a>. She almost accepted it but rejected the offer because her agent said the gig would "ruin her career." Allison McInnis wound up playing the Pink Ranger instead.</p><p>While we'll never know if Adams' agent was correct in keeping her out of the superhero universe, becoming a Power Ranger isn't a death sentence for an actor's career. Just look at the success of Jason David Frank, otherwise known as Tommy Oliver.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A New Power Rangers Film Reboot Is In Production</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=successful-actors-in-the-power-rangers-universe>Successful Actors In The Power Rangers Universe</h2><p>Frank has been a member of the PR universe since the very beginning. He started as the evil Green Ranger in the first season, then evolved to become the series' featured hero in seasons like Power Ranger Zeo and Dino Thunder, albeit in different color suits. He also had a cameo in the 2017 Power Rangers&nbsp;reboot, once again reiterating why the franchise isn't so volatile after all. The funny thing is, Frank isn't the only <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actor from Power Rangers: Dino Thunder</a>&nbsp;who made it big.</p><p>Emma Lahana, who played the Yellow Ranger, landed tons of roles following her Dino Thunder debut. Her most recent role happened to be on Marvel's Cloak And Dagger as the antihero Mayhem. She's not yet signed on to reprise the part in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but considering the impressive performance she put on, it would be a smart move on Disney's behalf to get Lahana back. Her character's story arc was also left unresolved, and there won't be a third season of Cloak And Dagger, so Mayhem's future is up in the air.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Shows That Blatantly Ripped Off Power Rangers</a></span></p><p>Successes aside, Adams' agent had the right idea by refusing their client a part in the Power Rangers universe. Because, if the actress would have, her career path could've diverged in an entirely different direction. Adams is talented enough that we know her superstardom was inevitable. However, there's a distinct possibility that Adams would have missed out on memorable roles like Lois Lane in Justice League or Dr. Banks in Arrival had she done Power Rangers: Lightspeed Rescue.</p><p>On the other side of things, perhaps playing the Pink Ranger would've propelled Adams towards stardom much earlier on in her career. In the 2000s, she was still taking on bit roles on television and smaller movies,&nbsp;continuing along this path until her featured role in 2010's Leap Year. That part gave Adams' career the boost it needed to make the actress a hot commodity in Hollywood. But, had Adams decided to play the Pink Lightspeed Ranger, her movie career might have begun much earlier on, or later, depending on how you look at it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Adams Is On Instagram...And She Has An Agenda</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYprFdlrGiudJmmKWln6jBbrzLmrCenF2WerG71p6pZqqRo7SmvoyopZydXZfCtXnHnqmeq12stbp50qGcZpyZmbu1ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2famy-adams-almost-played-a-power-ranger-once-but-heres-why-she-didnt.html&text=Amy%20Adams%20Almost%20Played%20A%20%27Power%20Ranger%27%20Once%2c%20But%20Here%27s%20Why%20She%20Didn%27t&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famy-adams-almost-played-a-power-ranger-once-but-heres-why-she-didnt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2famy-adams-almost-played-a-power-ranger-once-but-heres-why-she-didnt.html&title=Amy%20Adams%20Almost%20Played%20A%20%27Power%20Ranger%27%20Once%2c%20But%20Here%27s%20Why%20She%20Didn%27t" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2famy-adams-almost-played-a-power-ranger-once-but-heres-why-she-didnt.html&title=Amy%20Adams%20Almost%20Played%20A%20%27Power%20Ranger%27%20Once%2c%20But%20Here%27s%20Why%20She%20Didn%27t" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2famy-adams-almost-played-a-power-ranger-once-but-heres-why-she-didnt.html&title=Amy%20Adams%20Almost%20Played%20A%20%27Power%20Ranger%27%20Once%2c%20But%20Here%27s%20Why%20She%20Didn%27t" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famy-adams-almost-played-a-power-ranger-once-but-heres-why-she-didnt.html&description=Amy%20Adams%20Almost%20Played%20A%20%27Power%20Ranger%27%20Once%2c%20But%20Here%27s%20Why%20She%20Didn%27t" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./azra-mohyeddin-who-is-zia-mohiuddin-second-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Azra Mohyeddin: Who is Zia Mohiuddin second wife?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./15-people-these-celebs-notoriously-dated-before-coming-out-of-the-closet.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 People These Celebs Notoriously Dated Before Coming Out Of The Closet">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
