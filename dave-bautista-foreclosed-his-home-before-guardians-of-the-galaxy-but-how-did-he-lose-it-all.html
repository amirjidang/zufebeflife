The franchise has been changing the game for nearly 15 years, and now that it's <a href=#>shifted in Phase Four</a>, things are only going to get crazier from here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Within the umbrella franchise are smaller franchises like the Guardians of the Galaxy films. Dave Bautista plays Drax in the franchise, and while <a href=#>his time as the character could be ending</a>, he will always be appreciative of how landing the role changed his life forever.</p><p>Let's shine a light on Bautista and how the role of Drax got him out of a bad financial spot.</p><h2 id=dave-bautista-was-a-popular-sports-entertainer-before-acting>Dave Bautista Was A Popular Sports Entertainer Before Acting</h2><p>During the 2000s, WWE's Attitude Era was coming to an end, and an injection of fresh talent was being used to bring the promotion into a new era. Enter Dave Bautista, who quickly became a powerhouse in the company and one of the most popular superstars of his era.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite competing against names like Randy Orton, John Cena, and Chris Jericho, Bautista managed to consistently stand out from the pack thanks to his physical appearance, his work in the ring, and his skills on the microphone. The man was the total package, and his time in the WWE helped cement his place in pro wrestling history.</p><p>While with the company, Bautista truly excelled at being a heel, or a villainous character. This was something that helped set him up for some of the roles he would pull down in acting.</p><p>"I found out in wrestling that I like being the bad guy. And I don’t know why this happens, but there’s something about me that people like as a bad guy," <a href=#>the former WWE star said</a>.</p><p>The former WWE Champion, World Heavyweight Champion, and World Tag Team Champion eventually departed the WWE, and he made the bold decision to pursue acting, which reshaped his life permanently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Fans Feel About Zoe Saldana Taking On A Different Role In 'Guardians Of The Galaxy 3'</a></span></p><h2 id=he-39-s-become-a-star-at-the-box-office>He's Become A Star At The Box Office</h2><p>These days, Dave Bautista is best known as a force of nature in Hollywood. He didn't start off starring in hit films, but once filmmakers saw what he could do in front of the cameras, he began landing larger roles in impressive films.</p><p>Bautista's biggest hits include the Guardians of the Galaxy films, Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, the Bond film Spectre, Blade Runner 2049, Army of the Dead, and Dune, which just started a potential powerhouse franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still not impressed? The actor will also be appearing in Thor: Love and Thunder, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and Knives Out 2, which is easily one of the most anticipated non-superhero movies of the year.</p><p>Countless WWE superstars have tried their hand at transitioning into acting, but few have been as successful as Bautista. Sure, Hulk Hogan and The Rock laid out the blueprint, but Bautista has become an exceptionally large star in his own right.</p><p>It's a good thing that the star performer was able to score a role in the MCU, because at one point, things were not looking good for him financially.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Guardians Of The Galaxy 3’: Will Poulter Beats Rége Jean-Page To Play Adam Warlock</a></span></p><h2 id=bautista-was-down-bad-before-breaking-out>Bautista Was Down Bad Before Breaking Out</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Men's Journal</a>, the actor opened up about his career, noting that the first Guardians film changed his life.</p><p>According to Bautista, "I tend to get into things on the later side. Guardians changed the trajectory of my life. It gave me a new start. It stripped away everything that I had in wrestling and let people see me as an actor. I was broke. My house was foreclosed on. I had just lost everything. I was barely working. I couldn’t get auditions."</p><p>It's wild to think that someone who had so much success earlier on in his life could have reached this point. Then again, after departing the WWE and struggling to get auditions, it's easier to see why his bank account started to dwindle.</p><p>Bautista has continued landing major roles on the big screen, and he even hopped back into the ring for some WWE action. Since breaking out in the MCU, he has steadily helped his net worth climb up to a healthy $16 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About The 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Holiday Special'</a></span></p><p>Bautista's journey from the WWE to the box office has been a remarkable one, and learning that he overcame dire straits to make it happen just adds to its impressiveness. It just goes to show that hard work and capitalizing on the right opportunities can change someone's life in profound ways.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'Meredith Quill' Earned Her Part In 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2' In A Unique Way</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6VYq%2BiwdOiqq2ZXZu8s7HCpaasnZRitaq%2FjKGmpp1dl7Knu9GeZKCtkaexqq3NrGSonl2ptaZ5xpqjmrCpYq%2B2wIyhprBllJ6xbrTEZqOoq5VitrV5wKWjaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdave-bautista-foreclosed-his-home-before-guardians-of-the-galaxy-but-how-did-he-lose-it-all.html&text=Dave%20Bautista%20Foreclosed%20His%20Home%20Before%20%27Guardians%20Of%20The%20Galaxy%27%20But%20How%20Did%20He%20Lose%20It%20All%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdave-bautista-foreclosed-his-home-before-guardians-of-the-galaxy-but-how-did-he-lose-it-all.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdave-bautista-foreclosed-his-home-before-guardians-of-the-galaxy-but-how-did-he-lose-it-all.html&title=Dave%20Bautista%20Foreclosed%20His%20Home%20Before%20%27Guardians%20Of%20The%20Galaxy%27%20But%20How%20Did%20He%20Lose%20It%20All%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdave-bautista-foreclosed-his-home-before-guardians-of-the-galaxy-but-how-did-he-lose-it-all.html&title=Dave%20Bautista%20Foreclosed%20His%20Home%20Before%20%27Guardians%20Of%20The%20Galaxy%27%20But%20How%20Did%20He%20Lose%20It%20All%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdave-bautista-foreclosed-his-home-before-guardians-of-the-galaxy-but-how-did-he-lose-it-all.html&title=Dave%20Bautista%20Foreclosed%20His%20Home%20Before%20%27Guardians%20Of%20The%20Galaxy%27%20But%20How%20Did%20He%20Lose%20It%20All%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdave-bautista-foreclosed-his-home-before-guardians-of-the-galaxy-but-how-did-he-lose-it-all.html&description=Dave%20Bautista%20Foreclosed%20His%20Home%20Before%20%27Guardians%20Of%20The%20Galaxy%27%20But%20How%20Did%20He%20Lose%20It%20All%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./david-crane-net-worth-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Crane Net Worth  How Much is David Crane Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./danny-balis-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-301656-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danny Balis Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
