Despite their hectic careers, Post and Justin always find time to do something fun together, whether that's going to parties with friends, playing video games, or simply making music together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Post, who is one of the most recognizable rappers in the world, surprised fans when he labeled Justin his "brother"; some argued that their bromance was somewhat unexpected. When they first started hanging out together, certain Bieber fans questioned what the duo could possibly have in common.</p><p>Aside from his wife, Hailey Baldwin, Post is possibly Justin's closest friend in Hollywood, but what else is there to know about this 'doting duo'? Here are 15 little known facts you should know.</p><h2 id=justin-and-post-malone-s-bromance-started-in-march-2016><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Justin and Post Malone’s Bromance Started in March 2016</span></h2><p class=p1>From what fans have gathered, Post Malone’s friendship with Justin Bieber didn’t commence until March 2016. This was when Justin uploaded a photo of himself with the Texas-born rapper/singer-songwriter to Instagram.</p><p class=p1>The two appeared to be having a conversation while smoking a cigarette, and the caption read: “silly people’s.” The rest was history after that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-personally-chose-post-malone-to-be-his-opening-act-on-tour><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Justin Personally Chose Post Malone To Be His Opening Act On Tour</span></h2><p class=p1>When Justin was putting together his Purpose Tour in support of his fourth studio album, he personally hand-picked Post Malone to be his opening act on the North American leg. Post Malone was still riding high from the success of his song, "White Iverson", so the new business relationship as touring buddies seemed to make perfect sense.</p><h2 id=post-malone-considers-justin-bieber-his-brother><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Post Malone Considers Justin Bieber His Brother</span></h2><p class=p1>Post Malone has often referred to Justin as his brother, despite the fact that their friendship only blossomed in 2016. It would seem that the two have enough things in common to think of each other as coming from the same family. This explains why the two always speak so highly of one another in interviews.</p><h2 id=they-don-t-talk-about-their-views-on-religion><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>They Don’t Talk About Their Views On Religion</span></h2><p class=p1>After it was claimed that Bieber had canceled his tour to focus his attention on Christ and dedicating his life to his religion, Post told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;(in a revealing interview) that his friend had apparently gifted his church with a whopping $10 million. Post described the Bieb's church as “a total cult,” adding that “we don’t talk about this stuff.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-share-the-same-humor-hence-why-they-get-along-so-well><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They Share The Same Humor, Hence Why They Get Along So Well</span></h2><p class=p1>Fans will have already come across a number of silly photos that Post and Bieber have posted of one another on social media. However, when Post playfully choked his pal in one of the snaps, some believed the two had gone too far with their joking antics.</p><p class=p1>Post Malone later issued a statement, saying: “He’s my big brother and we like to roughhouse… if we was fighting someone would have done something instead of just sit around while the beibs [sic] gets chokeslammed.”</p><p class=p1>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos That Change The Way We See Justin Bieber</a></p><h2 id=justin-has-heavily-supported-post-malone-s-career><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Justin Has Heavily Supported Post Malone’s Career</span></h2><p class=p1>Following the release of Post Malone's second studio album, Beerbongs & Bentleys, in August 2018, Justin was one of the first celebrities to congratulate Post Malone on the release of yet another amazing record.</p><p class=p1>"Proud of my brother <a href=#><span class=s1>@PostMalone</span></a> on his new album,” Justin said in a tweet to his millions of fans, clearly indicating his support for his pal’s career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-and-post-malone-were-bro-ing-out-at-coachella-2018><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Justin And Post Malone Were Bro-ing Out At Coachella 2018</span></h2><p class=p1>In 2018, while Bieber was still on hiatus from music, the two decided to hit up Coachella with a few of their friends, and it goes without saying that the two had a blast partying it up with while enjoying some of the biggest songs of the year.</p><p class=p1>Justin was also in tow to see Post take to the stage and perform during his set at the festival. The Biebs watched from the crowd.</p><h2 id=justin-gave-his-first-performance-since-canceling-his-tour-at-a-post-malone-concert><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Justin Gave His First Performance Since Canceling His Tour At A Post Malone Concert</span></h2><p class=p1>On June 29, 2018, Justin gave his first live performance after his tour cancellation, as he joined Post Malone onstage at his concert at the Hollywood Bowl. The two stars sang their collaboration, "Deja Vu". Before leaving the stage, JB was heard saying: <span class=s1>“I love you with all my heart… I’m rooting for him.

Just a few years ago, it wasn’t uncommon to see JB with the likes of the Kardashians, Jenners, Lil Za, and Lil Twist.
