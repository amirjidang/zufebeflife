You also probably think you know EVERYTHING about her love life as well. If you were a teenager in the 90s, chances are you listened to Alanis Morissette’s uber-famous album, Jagged Little Pill on repeat – especially if you were going through your own breakup. Recently, Alanis took that album, years later, and it's now a Broadway musical.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All those songs were ripped directly from Alanis’s soul as she basically laid her diary out in song form and opened up about her vulnerability to the entire world. But not everyone loved her for it, and she in return put up walls around herself – but never apologized for her talents.</p><p>There are those Alanis is extremely close to, and those she chooses to keep at bay.&nbsp;Here&nbsp;are&nbsp;20 of those very people.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-material-mario-treadway><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Inner Circle Material: Mario Treadway</span></h2><p>After years of dealing with breakups, a majority of the high profiled ones, Alanis finally found her Prince Charming in the form of rapper Mario Treadway. The couple married back in 2010 and have three kids together. They’ve even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">collaborated on projects</a> together over the years and are still extremely close.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=big-nope-dave-coulier><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Big Nope: Dave Coulier</span></h2><p>We all know the song: “You Outta Know” has been the biggest question mark in all of music since Carly Simon’s “You’re So Vain” came out. The song is about a young woman falling for an older guy who ends up leaving her harshly. Everyone suspected it was about comedian Dave Coulier, whom Alanis dated when she was just 14. Turns out, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">we were right.</a></p><h2 id=inner-circle-material-her-twin-brother-wade-morissette><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Inner Circle Material: Her Twin Brother Wade Morissette</span></h2><p>Didn’t know that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alanis has a twin brother named Wade</a>? Well, join the club – A LOT of people didn’t. Wade is actually a yoga instructor and also a therapist (who wrote a book) and he and Alanis are very close as most twins usually are. He even worked for a bit in the music industry like his sister. It’s good to always keep family close.</p><h2 id=big-nope-tom-ballanco><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Big Nope: Tom Ballanco</span></h2><p>Not everyone really wants to be around their ex constantly, especially if you had a weird breakup and, let’s face it, a great deal of Alanis’s relationship ended strangely: with usually her writing songs about what happened. Her break up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American activist Tom Ballanco</a> was no different. They dated for two years back from 2007-2009.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inner-circle-material-older-brother-chad><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Inner Circle Material: Older Brother Chad</span></h2><p>You won’t hear Alanis <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talk about her brothers too often</a>, especially her older brother Chad, who is a businessman. However, if you look at her social media pages, you’ll find out some info about them. Apparently, she is close to both Chad and Wade and their children and she often makes time for her beloved family.</p><h2 id=big-nope-ryan-reynolds><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Big Nope: Ryan Reynolds</span></h2><p>A lot of people are surprised to learn that both superstar Ryan Reynolds was once engaged to the singer/songwriter Alanis. After meeting back in 2002, they were engaged to each other two years later. But apparently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan ended the relationship</a> and Alanis was completely shattered over it, so she took it out in her music.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-material-james-corden><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Inner Circle Material: James Corden</span></h2><p>Recently, in a very personal interview with The Guardian, Alanis was asked who would she like to play her in a movie about her life. She was quick to answer playfully (at least we think it was playfully):<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> late-night talk show host James Corden</a>. Both she and James did a hilarious remake of Alanis’ epic song “Ironic” changing the lyrics to match today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=big-nope-dash-mihok><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Big Nope: Dash Mihok</span></h2><p>In case you were keeping track, you can add <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actor Dash Mihok </a>to the list of men who have scorned Alanis (or so we think). There’s not much to know about these two as a couple even though they dated from 1998-2001, and to some people, three years is a long time. We’re sure she’s written a song or two about him as well.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-material-drew-barrymore><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Inner Circle Material: Drew Barrymore</span></h2><p>Little did people know, but actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drew Barrymore was the person</a> who brought the paramours, Alanis and Ryan Reynolds – indirectly, that is. It was Drew’s birthday party in 2002 where the two met and fell in love. Now, we’re assuming that you can’t get into these parties unless invited (or super famous) so we wonder who Drew sided with?</p><h2 id=big-nope-glen-ballard><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Big Nope: Glen Ballard</span></h2><p>A lot of people would call Glen Ballard the mastermind behind Jagged Little Pill, even if he wasn’t. Ballard was Alanis’s producer who “encouraged me to be fearless about sharing (her pain)” the singer said. They also dated, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the relationship ended rather badly</a> when she didn’t include him in future work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inner-circle-material-alicia-silverstone><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Inner Circle Material: Alicia Silverstone</span></h2><p>It’s always fun when you learn two of your favorite celebrities growing up are actually best friends in real life. That’s the case with actress Alicia Silverstone and Alanis, who met when they were just mere kids at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alanis’ concert in 1995</a>. And they’re still friends! And spend time with each other’s families on a normal basis.</p><h2 id=big-nope-jessica-biel><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Big Nope: Jessica Biel</span></h2><p>After Alanis and Ryan Reynolds broke things off (or, rather, he broke things off with her) people believed it was because Ryan was stepping out with another actress at the time. Ryan had been seen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">around town with Jessica Biel</a>, who was his co-star in Blade: Trinity during production and shortly AFTER he and Alanis had broken up. Yikes.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-material-the-cast-dogma-maybe><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Inner Circle Material: The Cast Dogma, Maybe?</span></h2><p>Back when Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were high on their “besties forever” Oscar win, they starred in Kevin Smith’s comedy/action Dogma with an all-star cast. The surprise star of the movie came at the end, though: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alanis as God</a>. It appeared that EVERYONE was close on the set, so it’s not far fetched to believe they’re all friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=big-nope-scarlett-johansson><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Big Nope: Scarlett Johansson</span></h2><p>Shortly (and we mean SHORTLY) after his split from Alanis, Ryan Reynolds started dating actress Scarlett Johansson while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alanis was still in mourning for the dead relationship</a>, and then shortly after that, the two actors were married. That can’t sit well with Alanis and maybe she doesn’t blame Scarlett, it’s certain she wouldn’t be buddy-buddy with her either.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-material-her-kiddos><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Inner Circle Material: Her Kiddos</span></h2><p>Alanis appears to be one of those mothers who is close to her children and is not only a great mom but also can be a great friend as well. She announced the birth of her third child (Winter Mercy Morissette-Treadway) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">last April </a>(Winter joins sister Onyx Solace and brother Ever Imre). Alanis seems like the type who will forever be close to her kids.</p><h2 id=big-nope-blake-lively><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Big Nope: Blake Lively</span></h2><p>Alanis has said in the past that she has forgiven all her exes for what they’ve done to her, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wishes they have forgiven her too</a> for spilling the beans about intimate details of their relationships in her songs but is she really over it? I mean, would she be friends with, say, Blake Lively if she’s still married to her ex? Not sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inner-circle-material-taylor-hawkins><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Inner Circle Material: Taylor Hawkins</span></h2><p>Search your memory for this: Taylor Hawkins is the drummer from Foo Fighters and was given his first big break by Alanis herself. “You know I owe so much to her,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>. “For giving me that space to be a show-off!” Taylor started his career by drumming for her on stage and hopes to have a reunion with her soon.</p><h2 id=big-nope-tori-amos><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Big Nope: Tori Amos</span></h2><p>A long time ago, when both were at the heights of their career, both Alanis and singer Tori Amos had quite the feud going. When Amos first heard Jagged Little Pill, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said it</a> “made her ears hurt” and Alanis decided to confront her about it when they both toured together. It was a long time ago and they’ve put it in the past.</p><h2 id=inner-circle-material-just-normal-non-famous-friends><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Inner Circle Material: Just Normal Non-Famous Friends</span></h2><p>Any famous person will tell you that you always need your friends around in order to keep yourself grounded to reality. Especially when things start to feel <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">like they’re spiraling out </a>of control. Alanis seems to have a group of rock-solid, non-famous friends that surround her constantly and she’s often seen out and about with them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=big-nope-robert-christgau><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Big Nope: Robert Christgau</span></h2><p>To be honest, does any really high profile person actually enjoy critics? Especially music singers/songwriters when it comes to music critics. One of Alanis’s most <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">outspoken critics </a>was Robert Christgau, who was extremely passive-aggressive with the young artist when Jagged Little Pill came out and called her a “privileged phony.”</p><p>References: romper, businessinsider, zimbio, marieclaire, nickiswift, theguardian</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWTmrmmrtJmrqGnXZa%2FpnnPmqmtZZ%2BbeqK4wKegrGWdpL%2Bqv9Keq62do2Kwqr7CpZxmaWBiwKmxw2alnq6Vp3qtsdNmoKdn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-celebs-who-are-part-of-alanis-morissettes-circle-10-shed-never-let-in.html&text=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Part%20Of%20Alanis%20Morissette%27s%20Circle%20%2810%20She%27d%20Never%20Let%20In%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebs-who-are-part-of-alanis-morissettes-circle-10-shed-never-let-in.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebs-who-are-part-of-alanis-morissettes-circle-10-shed-never-let-in.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Part%20Of%20Alanis%20Morissette%27s%20Circle%20%2810%20She%27d%20Never%20Let%20In%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-celebs-who-are-part-of-alanis-morissettes-circle-10-shed-never-let-in.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Part%20Of%20Alanis%20Morissette%27s%20Circle%20%2810%20She%27d%20Never%20Let%20In%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebs-who-are-part-of-alanis-morissettes-circle-10-shed-never-let-in.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Part%20Of%20Alanis%20Morissette%27s%20Circle%20%2810%20She%27d%20Never%20Let%20In%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebs-who-are-part-of-alanis-morissettes-circle-10-shed-never-let-in.html&description=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Part%20Of%20Alanis%20Morissette%27s%20Circle%20%2810%20She%27d%20Never%20Let%20In%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-actors-who-rejected-the-mcu-and-regret-it.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Actors Who Rejected The MCU (And Regret It)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
