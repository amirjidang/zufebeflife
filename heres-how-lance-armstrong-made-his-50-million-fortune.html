Known for his lightning-fast cycling skills and a knack for leaving his competitors in the dust, Armstrong pedaled his way to fortune. Despite being stripped of his Tour de France titles for doping and losing endorsement deals that made his net worth dwindle from $125 million to&nbsp;$50 million, Armstrong's wealth is evidence of speed, determination, and <a href=#>a dash of controversy</a>. Buckle up and prepare to be amazed as we unravel the extraordinary story of how Armstrong transformed his two wheels into a multimillion-dollar cash machine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lance-armstrong-s-early-life-and-times>Lance Armstrong’s Early Life and Times</h2><p>Born with the name Lance Edward Gunderson, this cycling dynamo burst into the world on September 18, 1971, at the Methodist Hospital in Richardson, Texas. With a mix of Canadian, Dutch, and Norwegian blood flowing through his veins, Lance was <a href=#>destined for greatness</a> from day one. As the son of Linda Gayle, a secretary extraordinaire, and Eddie Charles Gunderson, the legendary route manager for The Dallas Morning News, Lance had the speed of a typewriter and the strategic skills of a newspaper delivery route in his DNA.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He attended Plano East Senior High School, where he probably raced through hallways faster than anyone else. When it comes to relationships, Lance's love life could give a spin class a run for its money. From marrying Kristin Richard and having three kids to a whirlwind romance with <a href=#>singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow</a> and finally finding love with Anna Hansen with whom he has two other children, this cycling heartthrob knows how to pedal through the ups and downs of romance. So, how did Lance acquire his $50 million fortune?

As one of the most accomplished cyclists of his time, Armstrong's achievements on the tracks brought him not only fame and admiration but also significant financial rewards. His seven consecutive Tour de France wins from 1999 to 2005 established him as a dominant <a href=#>force in professional cycling</a> and these victories not only earned him prize money but also lucrative bonuses and performance-based incentives.</p><p>The substantial earnings from these achievements contributed significantly to his net worth, allowing him to amass a considerable fortune. Furthermore, Armstrong's success on the cycling circuit attracted sponsorship opportunities. Companies associated with the sport, such as bike manufacturers and <a href=#>sports equipment brands</a>, sought to align themselves with his success. These partnerships provided additional financial support, further bolstering his net worth. Armstrong's determination and resilience on the tracks truly make his career a rewarding and inspiring one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=endorsement-deals-and-their-financial-impact>Endorsement Deals and Their Financial Impact</h2><p>With his remarkable achievements and strong public image, Armstrong became a highly sought-after figure for various brands, both within and outside the cycling industry. Companies like Nike, Oakley, and Trek recognized Armstrong's marketability and signed him as a brand ambassador. <a href=#>These endorsement deals</a> not only provided substantial financial compensation but also extended his reach and influence to a wider audience. Armstrong's association with these prominent brands elevated his status, allowing him to command higher endorsement fees and secure more lucrative contracts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's important to note that Armstrong's endorsement deals took a significant hit following the doping scandal that surrounded his career. After being stripped of his Tour de France titles in 2012, he faced legal repercussions and <a href=#>lost sponsorship deals</a> for doping. These setbacks led to a substantial decline in his net worth. However, Lance's independent investments made up for these setbacks and significantly contributed to his $50 million net worth. What are these independent investments?

At the heart of downtown Austin, Texas, you'll find Juan Pelota Cafe, <a href=#>his coffee shop</a> which he named with a playful nod to his testicular cancer journey. Right next door, he operates Mellow Johnny's, a bike shop that pays homage to his Tour de France moniker. He is also the founder of WeDu Sports, a company that sells customized sports equipment. His business genius doesn't stop there, it is evident in his investment portfolios too.</p><p>Armstrong made a great move when he snatched up stocks in SRAM Corporation and even served as their technical advisor. Trek Bicycle Corporation also made it onto his portfolio as he owns a small share of the corporation. Let's not forget his genius move of investing $100,000 into Lowercase Capital, which got him a sweet piece of the Uber pie. <a href=#>When Uber went public</a>, Lance's family saw a windfall of $20-$30 million.

In 1997, he kick-started the Lance Armstrong Foundation, a powerhouse supporting those affected by cancer. Bracelets that shine like sunshine, aptly named LiveStrong, generated over $325 million and sparked a movement of awareness. Lance also <a href=#>teamed up with Andre Agassi</a>, Muhammad Ali, and more sporting icons to create Athletes for Hope, a charity with a passion for volunteering among pros and inspiring the non-athletic crowd. Not one to shy away from a challenge, Lance blazed through marathons like a comet, pushing his limits and raising hundreds of thousands for his LiveStrong campaign.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="How Pep Guardiola Became One Of The Most Accomplished Football Managers In The World" href=#>How Pep Guardiola Became One Of The Most Accomplished Football Managers In The World</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biography</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CA Knowlege</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1pr7ErGShp6diuaK6wp5kmqqdqMGzu82gZKaZlJp6qbXSZmxpZZ2eua21zqdkn6eiqcKvsY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheres-how-lance-armstrong-made-his-50-million-fortune.html&text=Here%27s%20How%20Lance%20Armstrong%20Made%20His%20%2450%20Million%20Fortune&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-how-lance-armstrong-made-his-50-million-fortune.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-how-lance-armstrong-made-his-50-million-fortune.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Lance%20Armstrong%20Made%20His%20%2450%20Million%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheres-how-lance-armstrong-made-his-50-million-fortune.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Lance%20Armstrong%20Made%20His%20%2450%20Million%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheres-how-lance-armstrong-made-his-50-million-fortune.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Lance%20Armstrong%20Made%20His%20%2450%20Million%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-how-lance-armstrong-made-his-50-million-fortune.html&description=Here%27s%20How%20Lance%20Armstrong%20Made%20His%20%2450%20Million%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./heres-the-untold-truth-we-know-about-tony-dungys-wife-lauren-harris-375946-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heres The Untold Truth We Know About Tony Dungys Wife, Lauren Harris">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./green-days-billie-joe-armstrong-kicked-off-plane-for-saggy-pants-201139.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong Kicked Off Plane for Saggy Pants">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
