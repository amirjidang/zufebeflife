Armed with a combination of raw talent, hard work, and a hard-working label, success was inevitable for the band. BTS is managed by 'Big Hit Entertainment' which was founded by Bang Si-hyuk affectionately called Bang PD.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>BTS is the brainchild of Bang PD, together they have attained unimaginable success. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The band has broken numerous world records</a>. Bang PD recently gifted them with shares in Big Hit Entertainment. A move that could prove lucrative for all parties involved. From taking legal action against those making malicious comments against the band to granting them creative control. The BH co-CEO has proved that BTS is more than just a business to him.</p><h2 id=is-bang-pd-more-father-figure-than-ceo-to-bts>Is Bang PD More Father Figure Than CEO To BTS?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When BTS first debuted nearly a decade ago</a>,&nbsp;they were fairly young. The oldest member being 21 years old while the youngest was only 15 years old. It is safe to assume that Bang PD took on more than one role when it came to the management of the group. Although many have hailed him as 'the father' of BTS, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Soompi</a> reported that the hitmaker does not care much for the title.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Artists are not created by another individual. The moment that someone calls me [BTS’s] father or dad, BTS becomes a product, and I become someone who created a product. It doesn’t go with my philosophy, so I find it somewhat uncomfortable."</p><p>While BTS and Bang PD may have a close relationship that extends out of the studio, he is uncomfortable with the father figure narrative.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BTS Rocked the Stage at the 30th Lotte Family Concert 2020</a></span></p><h2 id=no-one-slanders-bts-and-gets-away-with-it-on-bang-pd-s-watch>No One Slanders BTS And Gets Away With It On Bang PD's Watch</h2><p>With huge success comes both the fans and the critics, and BTS has both fans and haters on a global scale. While some say that the band's music resonates with many people and carries messages of hope and encouragement, critics have slandered and aimed to tarnish the band's image.</p><p>However, that's not happening on Bang PD's watch! Protecting the K-pop sensation is of utmost importance to the Big Hit Entertainment co-CEO. The label has issued timely warnings against anyone making malicious comments against their artists. Big Hit does not hesitate to take legal action against anyone found wanting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cyberbullying has far-reaching effects and celebs are not immune to it either. Disapproval of BTS one thing but maliciously slandering them is another. At times people forget that artists are just human too.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Celebrate As Big Hit Entertainment Takes Serious Actions Against BTS Haters</a></span></p><h2 id=does-bang-pd-and-big-hit-entertainment-overwork-bts>Does Bang PD And Big Hit Entertainment Overwork BTS?</h2><p>Accusations of Bang PD and 'Big Hit Entertainment' overworking BTS have been made over the years, in fact, some of the band members themselves alluded to it in the past. Albeit said in a manner that seemed like a joke, some fans believed the members were trying to communicate something.</p><p>One incident that further spurned these rumors was when Jimin reportedly fainted during a fan meet in 2015. And V is revealed to have been performing while sick in Japan. There have been many incidences that have led fans to criticize 'Big Hit Entertainment'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It goes without saying that sometimes overworking comes with the territory for most performers. As one Redditor pointed out, "I think everyone in the entertainment industry is overworked to some degree... but I think that BTS has a pretty good schedule."</p><p>The fact that BTS renewed their contracts with their label is a strong indicator that they're fine with the label's manner of handling business. They have a strong work ethic and are known to push themselves for their fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ARMY Freaks Out As They Discover BTS RM Has Checked Their Stories In New Game</a></span></p><h2 id=he-gave-bts-equity-in-big-hit-entertainment>He Gave BTS Equity In Big Hit Entertainment</h2><p>BTS is undoubtedly Big Hit Entertainment's highest-earning client. Per The Hollywood Reporter, "the BTS ecosystem is so enormous, it accounts for $4.65 billion of South Korea's GDP. That's enough to put it in the same league as Samsung and Hyundai."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Reuters</a>, ahead of Big Hit Entertainment's much-anticipated IPO, it was reported that Bang PD gifted the band with&nbsp;478,695 common shares in the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Members of hugely popular South Korean K-Pop band BTS are expected to become multimillionaire shareholders after receiving shares in their label, Big Hit Entertainment, as it prepares an initial public offering (IPO) that could raise up to 962.6 billion won ($811 million)."</p><p>Gifting the band a stake in the label is Bang PD's way of boosting morale and strengthening Big Hit Entertainment's relationship with BTS.</p><p>"Big Hit CEO and largest shareholder Bang Si-hyuk last month gave 478,695 common shares to the seven BTS members, or 68,385 per each, 'to strengthen long-term partnership with major artists and boost morale', Big Hit said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ne-Yo Said This About Beyonce, And Her Fans Are Furious</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp2WZo8CqsMRmo6inm2KutXnBmqWgZaCZwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mrqKsmGKvtb%2BO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fan-inside-look-at-bang-pds-relationship-with-bts.html&text=An%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Bang%20PD%27s%20Relationship%20With%20BTS&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fan-inside-look-at-bang-pds-relationship-with-bts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fan-inside-look-at-bang-pds-relationship-with-bts.html&title=An%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Bang%20PD%27s%20Relationship%20With%20BTS" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fan-inside-look-at-bang-pds-relationship-with-bts.html&title=An%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Bang%20PD%27s%20Relationship%20With%20BTS" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fan-inside-look-at-bang-pds-relationship-with-bts.html&title=An%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Bang%20PD%27s%20Relationship%20With%20BTS" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fan-inside-look-at-bang-pds-relationship-with-bts.html&description=An%20Inside%20Look%20At%20Bang%20PD%27s%20Relationship%20With%20BTS" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./angela-lansbury-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angela Lansbury Net Worth  How Much is Lansbury Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alijah-kai-haggins-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-656915-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alijah Kai Haggins Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
