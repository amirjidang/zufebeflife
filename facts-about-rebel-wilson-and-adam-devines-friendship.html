New on the scene, the two were working to make names for themselves as comedians and actors. Today, the pair are practically household names. While they have many talents and successes separately, collaboration after collaboration has shown the world that they do even better as a duo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though there were many&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">poor reviews for Pitch Perfect 3</a>, Rebel Wilson’s talent still earned her acclaim. She was described as “flat out aca-larious” and credited for her portrayal of, “fat <a href=#>Amy Winehouse</a>” (Rebel Wilson is a professional scene-stealer). While Devine has also built a fan base through his work on Workaholics and earned mainstream recognition for playing one of Haley’s flames on Modern Family, the best work out there is what he's done with Rebel Wilson.</p><p>The two support each other professionally and personally. Last fall, when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Devine announced his engagement</a> to Chloe Bridges, one of the first celebs to offer public congratulations was Wilson. Her comment on the Instagram engagement announcement was enthusiastic: “Adam, this is so exciting. I’m so happy for you guys.” Without any further ado, here are 15 aca-sweet facts about Rebel Wilson and Adam Devine’s friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-first-gig-together><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Their First Gig Together</span></h2><p>Many people believe that Pitch Perfect was the first time that <a href=#>Rebel Wilson (who's been on a fitness kick lately)</a>&nbsp;and Devine worked together, when in fact it was in 2011. In 2011, she was cast in an episode of the first season of Workaholics. It was her first US acting job and Wilson had to make out with Devine’s character while the pair were made-up in white and black <a href=#>Juggalo</a> (Insane Clown Posse) makeup. It took 50 takes to get the makeout scene just right, so the two were very comfortable together by the time the episode wrapped.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern Family Finale Is The End Of An Era, But The On-Set Props Find New Homes</a></span></p><h2 id=their-romantic-friendship><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Their 'Romantic' Friendship</span></h2><p>The chemistry between Wilson and Devine is undeniable. A willingness to take on comedic and romantic roles is something they share, which keeps them working together. Devine says, “I get very misty. I like a good romance. I like to root for the underdog. So, I’m all for a good rom-com. It’s stuff you wish would happen to you. Why can’t I have a meet-cute? I only have meet-disgustings."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising Celebrity Bromances You Never Knew Were A Thing</a></span></p><h2 id=the-new-emma-stone-amp-ryan-gosling><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>The 'New Emma Stone & Ryan Gosling'</span></h2><p>While Devine and Wilson are not ‘typical’ romantic leads, their friend-next-door vibe is something a lot more relatable for the general public than the generic ‘Hollywood hot’ leads. Perhaps they are the next-gen Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Wilson joked about their infamous kiss scene in Pitch Perfect 2:&nbsp;"We were going for an MTV Award Best Kiss. It's all about the trophies!"</p><h2 id=their-comedic-spark><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Their Comedic Spark</span></h2><p>After their first time working together, there was a strong connection that many actors wait a lifetime for. Two people who love to work together, improvise together, and ham it up, like Devine and Wilson do, definitely belong together professionally. They've made some unexpected comedy, but they've probably also triggered some delays on TV show and movie sets, while trying out new things together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">21 Times Ryan Reynolds And Blake Lively Were The Funniest Couple On The Internet</a></span></p><h2 id=rebel-s-work-husband><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Rebel's 'Work Husband'</span></h2><p>Everyone loves having that favorite co-worker to hang out with during coffee breaks. For Wilson, Devine is this person. Devine said, "We actually have the same agent, and every time I talk to her, she's like, 'We need to get you and Rebel in a movie together where you're love interests...So, yeah. We're very comfortable with each other."</p><h2 id=romantic-leads-together><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Romantic Leads Together</span></h2><p>If fate had been a little different, we might not have seen Amy and Boomer come together in Pitch Perfect 2, mainly because Wilson’s character, Amy, was supposed to be with another love interest. Wilson said, “They changed it just a few weeks before we started filming and thank god they did because Adam and I are mates and I can’t imagine anyone else.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=making-beautiful-music><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Making Beautiful Music</span></h2><p>Two people with similar talent sets and great chemistry can push each other to wonderful and exciting places, vocally, dramatically, and more. Devine said, “I’m hoping me and her just keep going down this path where once a year, we have a weird project together until we’re old people. It’s sort of a Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder situation where we just star in a 100 movies together."</p><h2 id=improvisational-genius><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Improvisational Genius</span></h2><p>Rebel and Adam working together isn’t just about pushing past their typical limits - it’s also about watching...and helping others working with them to up their comedic games. Devine said, “Rebel and I have such a history with those “Pitch Perfect” movies, so we clicked back into it. And Priyanka — she’s such a pro, with her Bollywood background. It was really fun watching Liam because he hadn’t had much experience doing that. Watching Liam be goofy, since he’s the coolest guy on earth, was really awesome.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pushing-each-other-towards-personal-growth><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Pushing Each Other Towards Personal Growth</span></h2><p>Professional friendship isn’t just about pushing someone in their craft, it can also be about supporting and acknowledging their growth as a person. Rebel said, "I just think Adam is so cute and, just as a friend, I've loved watching him grow from when I first met him to now" and added, "(he’s) grown into such a sensible, caring man. Not that he wasn't caring, but he was a bit of a party boy when I first met him and I just love the man he's kind of grown into and so proud of all the work that he's doing."</p><h2 id=lining-up-with-other-great-comedic-duos><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lining Up With Other Great Comedic Duos</span></h2><p>A great comedic duo is hard to find, but when something just clicks, everyone from casting agents to audiences really feel it. Devine said, “I knew from the get-go Rebel was super funny. Then we did “Pitch Perfect.” Now this. It seems she’s Tina Fey to my Amy Poehler. Or the other way around.”</p><p>I personally am feeling more of a Catherine O’Hara/ Eugene Levy vibe from the two, but either way, I can’t wait to see what they do next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-thing-about-bumper-amp-amy><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Thing About Bumper & Amy</span></h2><p>Bumper and Amy are such larger-than-life characters that seeing them together is comedic gold. In terms of less-traditional couples in the movies, Rebel is quick to quip about Hollywood casting standards, saying: “I am the average size of the American and Australian woman, and yet plus-size actresses have less than one percent of all leading roles, I think, even though they are the majority of women.”</p><p>Hopefully, their work can open up doors for others, providing a wider range of realistic bodies that audiences can relate to.</p><h2 id=celebrating-their-successes><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Celebrating Their Successes</span></h2><p>Devine and Wilson have done nothing but support each other, whether they're saying kind words about each other during interviews, recommending each other for parts, or connecting during their downtime. Hollywood would certainly be a kinder place if more coworkers were like this dynamic duo.</p><h2 id=getting-through-failures><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Getting Through Failures</span></h2><p>Some projects fall flat. Unfortunately for Devine and Wilson, their movie,&nbsp;Isn’t It Romantic, was not well received by fans, scoring a mere 47 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Atlantic critic, Christopher Orr, wrote: “We now have an official subgenre in which a woman is initially presented as unattractive; is concussed into a fantasy in which she becomes impossibly desirable; and from the experience gleans important, affirmative lessons about believing in herself.” Hopefully, the pair have better luck on their next project.</p><h2 id=bad-ideas-together><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Bad Ideas, Together</span></h2><p>Adam and Rebel got together for a reality series called Bad Ideas, where Adam travels around connecting with celebrity friends. He and his famous friends try out stunts together. In the episode where Adam worked with Rebel, the pair donned cowboy and cowgirl outfits and rode on top of fake horses. They also worked on their lasso skills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-s-next><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What's Next</span></h2><p>While there’s nothing in the works that we know of right now, it probably won’t be long before these two 'partner up' again for a new and fun project. Devine said, "Me and Rebel love working with each other, and we have a great time on set. We have known each other for so long, and it is kind of crazy that we have done so many projects together, and I think the stars are aligned for us to get to continue to make movies together.”</p><p><strong>Sources</strong>: Bustle, Daily Mail, Refinery 29, Chicago Tribune, Showbiz Cheat Sheet</p><p><span class=next-single>&nbsp;Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things Anna Kendrick's Said About Her Time On Twilight</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmpukqHqirs6uq2aqlZeyrXnWoqOsp55irq%2BwjJqbmqVdmbK3tc2eqmaeop6yr7DSoaCpZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffacts-about-rebel-wilson-and-adam-devines-friendship.html&text=Sweet%20Facts%20About%20Rebel%20Wilson%20And%20Adam%20Devine%27s%20Friendship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffacts-about-rebel-wilson-and-adam-devines-friendship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffacts-about-rebel-wilson-and-adam-devines-friendship.html&title=Sweet%20Facts%20About%20Rebel%20Wilson%20And%20Adam%20Devine%27s%20Friendship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffacts-about-rebel-wilson-and-adam-devines-friendship.html&title=Sweet%20Facts%20About%20Rebel%20Wilson%20And%20Adam%20Devine%27s%20Friendship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffacts-about-rebel-wilson-and-adam-devines-friendship.html&title=Sweet%20Facts%20About%20Rebel%20Wilson%20And%20Adam%20Devine%27s%20Friendship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffacts-about-rebel-wilson-and-adam-devines-friendship.html&description=Sweet%20Facts%20About%20Rebel%20Wilson%20And%20Adam%20Devine%27s%20Friendship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-best-pull-up-bars-for-home-workouts-on-a-budget.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Best Pull-up Bars for Home Workouts on a Budget">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./steve-yzerman-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Steve Yzerman Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
