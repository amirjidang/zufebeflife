As a result, there was always a lot of interest in Hoffman's next project and facts like <a href=#>he refused to co-star with Adam Sandler</a> in one of the actor's classic comedies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When news broke that Hoffman suddenly passed away, his fans all over the world were shocked. Many of those same fans were equally surprised when it was revealed that Hoffman refused to leave any of his impressive fortune to his children.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-philip-seymour-hoffman-39-s-estate-after-he-passed-away>What Happened To Philip Seymour Hoffman's Estate After He Passed Away?</h2><p>Anytime that Philip Seymour Hoffman appeared on the red carpet, he came across as the kind of guy that would never make it to the top of Hollywood. Instead, Hoffman always presented himself in a way that made it seem like he was destined for a very different path.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/philip-seymour-hoffman-wearing-a-t-shirt.jpg><p>Throughout most of Hollywood history, actors with loads of talent that looked like Hoffman have become character actors. The kind of performers that most people recognize but can't figure out where they know them from.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, unlike many of the best character actors in history, Hoffman could come alive in front of a camera in an undeniable way. As a result, Hoffman rose to fame, and he went on to headline movies with many of the biggest actors of his generation.</p><p>Thanks to how mesmerizing Hoffman could be on camera, he starred in big-budget movies like Twister and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Hoffman also was tapped to do battle with Tom Cruise on the big screen when he was cast as the villain in Mission: Impossible III.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tara Reid's Acting Career Would've Ended Had She Not Been Cast In The Big Lebowski, Here's Why She Owes Everything To The Cult Classic</a></span></p><p>Thanks to his roles in major movies like those and many of his acclaimed performances, the studios were willing to pay Hoffman big money. That allowed hin to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accumulate a truly impressive $25 million fortune</a> during his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On February 2, 2014, the playwright and screenwriter David Bar found Hoffman in his Manhattan apartment. The much-acclaimed actor who had passed away was only 46 years old when he was discovered by his friend.</p><p>Long before Hoffman passed away, he struggled with addiction. According to Hoffman's friends, it was believed the actor had his demons under control at the time he passed away. However, Hoffman relapsed and his autopsy confirmed he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took his final breath because of a combination of illegal and legal substances</a> in his body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/philip-seymour-hoffman-looking-at-peace.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When a star passes away, there often is a lot of conjecture about what will happen to their estate. Some perfect examples of that are the interest in <a href=#>what happened to Michael Jackson's estate</a> and the fact that people are curious <a href=#>if Elvis Presley's estate has grown since he passed away</a>.</p><p>Before Hoffman passed away, he accomplished a lot during his far too short life. While the masses will always remember Hoffman for the movies he starred in, it can easily be argued that becoming a father of three was far more meaningful than any film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/philip-seymour-hoffman-looking-lost.jpg><p>After Hoffman took his final breath, most of the reports about his passing included the fact that he had three children. With that information in mind, most observers assumed that Hoffman's estate would go to his kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To Raquel Welch, And Who Will Inherit Her $40 Million Fortune?</a></span></p><p>Before Hoffman passed away, he never got married. However, the actor might as well have since he was linked to his partner Mimi O'Donnell for roughly fifteen years up until Hoffman passed.</p><p>During Hoffman and O'Donnell's many years as a couple, they appeared to be the loves of each other's lives. As a result, it made sense that Hoffman left his entire estate to O'Donnell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/philip-seymour-hoffman-and-his-longtime-partner-mimi-o-donnell.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Hoffman took his final breath, The Mirror revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why the actor didn't leave anything to his three kids</a>. As that report stated, the reason why Hoffman didn't want his kids to have his fortune is he didn't want them to turn into the stereotype of "trust fund" kids. It was also reported that Hoffman hoped his kids would be raised in Manhattan, Chicago, or San Francisco after he passed.</p><p>While it is fascinating to know that Hoffman didn't leave anything to his children, the truth is more complicated than that. Since Hoffman's longtime partner he left everything to was the mother of his kids, it is obvious that his children weren't left to fend for themselves.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-philip-seymour-hoffman-39-s-son>What Happened To Philip Seymour Hoffman's Son?</h2><p>Before Philip Seymour Hoffman passed away, he made it clear that he didn't want to talk to the press about his private life. When Hoffman was interviewed by The Independent in 2012, he explained why he refused to talk about his partner and kids.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Ike Turner's Wives Didn't Get A Penny Of His Net Worth When He Died</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There's nothing risky in talking about your personal life. People do it all the time. That's not about risk. It's just about somebody wanting to talk about their personal life to the press. I'd rather not because my family doesn't have any choice. If I talk about them in the press, I'm giving them no choice. So I choose not to."</p><p>Due to Hoffman's decision to not talk about his kids, next to nothing is known about the actor's daughters other than their first names, Tallulah and Willa. However, when it comes to Hoffman's son, Cooper Hoffman decided to step into the spotlight in 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cooper-hoffman-and-alana-haim-at-the-new-york-film-critics-circle-awards-ceremony.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Philip Seymour Hoffman passed away, he worked with the acclaimed director Paul Thomas Anderson repeatedly. Philip Seymour Hoffman starred in Anderson's movies Boogie Nights, Magnolia, Punch-Drunk Love, and The Master.</p><p>Once Cooper Hoffman was 18 years old, he followed in his famous father's footsteps by agreeing to star in Anderson's movie Licorice Pizza. An acclaimed film, Licorice Pizza won many trophies and was nominated for many awards including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay Oscars.</p><p>As of the time of this writing, Cooper Hoffman has two movies that will be released in the future. One of those projects is directed by Ethan Hawke and stars that actor's daughter, Maya Hawke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinoaGcnr1uv8SypKitomK1sLLFppinZaKas7a%2FxJ1kraddnLa3sYyhoKxlk522rbDRnqVmoJmoeqa%2F05qrnmWRm8GmvoyhoKxllJqutbSMoZyrnaNixKm7jKCmrWWZqXqqutKtnJqcXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fphilip-seymour-hoffman-refused-to-give-his-children-his-estate-after-his-death-heres-who-got-it-instead.html&text=Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman%20Refused%20To%20Give%20His%20Children%20Any%20of%20His%20Humongous%20Estate%20After%20His%20Death%2c%20Her&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fphilip-seymour-hoffman-refused-to-give-his-children-his-estate-after-his-death-heres-who-got-it-instead.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fphilip-seymour-hoffman-refused-to-give-his-children-his-estate-after-his-death-heres-who-got-it-instead.html&title=Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman%20Refused%20To%20Give%20His%20Children%20Any%20of%20His%20Humongous%20Estate%20After%20His%20Death%2c%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fphilip-seymour-hoffman-refused-to-give-his-children-his-estate-after-his-death-heres-who-got-it-instead.html&title=Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman%20Refused%20To%20Give%20His%20Children%20Any%20of%20His%20Humongous%20Estate%20After%20His%20Death%2c%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fphilip-seymour-hoffman-refused-to-give-his-children-his-estate-after-his-death-heres-who-got-it-instead.html&title=Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman%20Refused%20To%20Give%20His%20Children%20Any%20of%20His%20Humongous%20Estate%20After%20His%20Death%2c%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fphilip-seymour-hoffman-refused-to-give-his-children-his-estate-after-his-death-heres-who-got-it-instead.html&description=Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman%20Refused%20To%20Give%20His%20Children%20Any%20of%20His%20Humongous%20Estate%20After%20His%20Death%2c%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./richest-woman-in-europe-heres-how-francoise-bettencourt-meyers-made-her-75-3-billion-dollar-fortune.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Richest Woman in Europe: Here's How Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers Made Her $75.3 Billion Dollar Fortu">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pete-davidson-gets-another-ariana-grande-inspired-tattoo-photo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pete Davidson Gets Another Ariana Grande-Inspired Tattoo: Photo">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
