Recurring crimes are common amongst wrestlers, and as you will see in this article, criminal offenses such as drunk driving and possession are common themes for wrestler crimes. Although, not all these offenses are so common, in this article you will see some absolutely embarrassing crimes as well, like urinating on a flight attended and showing off your private parts to an employee working at a hotel (yes, that happened); these wrestler crimes certainly leave you entertained, that’s for sure. Let’s now begin and check out these 15 crimes committed by wrestlers. Enjoy!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-wade-barrett>15) Wade Barrett</h2><p>In 2008, the former NXT winner was arrested in Tampa, Florida. <a title="Wade Barrett Net Worth" href=#>Barrett</a> was charged with battery and obstructing or opposing an officer. The incident took place because of an altercation between Barrett and a woman outside of “Champs” bar at 2 am. The female started the altercation by bumping into Barrett, as Barrett then tried to walk away, a plain-clothed police officer walked up to Barrett and another altercation began between the two. After the incident, the female refused to press any charges claiming she started everything. Barrett claims all he was trying to do was leave the scene and not cause any trouble. Barrett also said he did not know the man dressed in regular clothes was a police officer, as the situation would have been much different if he knew otherwise.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-jimmy-uso>14) Jimmy Uso</h2><p>The former tag team champion has found himself in prison one too many times. Jimmy Uso has a history of picking up 2 DUI’s. His first took place in 2011, when Uso was seen <a href=#>driving his car</a> the wrong way down a one-way street. The cops pulled him over and according to reports found out that his blood alcohol level was twice over the legal limit in Florida. A couple of years later in 2013, Uso was once again slapped with yet another DUI in Hillsborough County, Florida.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-jack-swagger>13) Jack Swagger</h2><p>Swagger spent some time in jail after being arrested on counts of suspicion of DUI, possession and speeding. The courts found Swagger <a href=#>guilty</a> for his DUI and speeding, but his charges for possession were dropped. Swagger was sentenced for a 6 month unsupervised probation and fined $1,498. Swagger was also ordered to attend an alcohol/substance education class for first-time DUI offenders. The situation happened February 19th, 2013, after a Smackdown taping. The officer pulled Swagger over for driving 10 mph faster than the limit. The cop questioned Swagger about marijuana due to the smell in&nbsp;his car, and Swagger came clean and told the cop he had smoked and apologized for it. Despite being very understanding throughout the whole process, a failed field sobriety test caused Swagger to be brought in for the night.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-william-regal>12) William Regal</h2><p>Get ready for this one, William Regal was arrested in 1997 for urinating on a flight attendant, yes, you read correctly. Regal regrets the entire situation and calls it a point in his life in where pills turned him “insane” and a point where life meant nothing to him. The situation took place while Regal was in WCW, while on a flight from Tokyo, Japan to Detroit. Regal barely remembers the situation, all he can remember was urinating with the door open, when a flight attendant tapped Regal on the shoulder, Regal turned around and urinated on the flight attendant. The next thing he apparently remembers is waking up in jail in Alaska.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-sunny>11) Sunny</h2><p>Sunny, also known as Tamara "Tammy" Lynch Sytch, endured some “not so sunny days” after her run with the WWE. Sunny was <a href=#>arrested</a> a total of 6 times in a short 4 month time span, her violations&nbsp;even included 3 arrests in 3 days. Most of her arrests came because of disputes with her boyfriend; the charges were disorderly conduct, assault, 3rd degree burglary and multiple counts of restraining order violations. In her most recent charge, Sunny was sentenced to 114 days in prison, which she fully served.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-scott-hall>10) Scott Hall</h2><p>Wrestling fans are well aware that <a title="Scott Hall Net Worth" href=#>Scott Hall</a> has been through a lot in the last 10 years. Over his difficult journey, one obstacle Hall struggled to overcome was alcoholism. Drinking caused Scott Hall to get arrested in 2012, after Hall allegedly choked out his girlfriend after falling into a drunken rage. Cops were called to Hall’s Florida home after receiving a call over a domestic disturbance; when the police arrived on the scene, Lisa Howell informed police that Hall had attacked her. Lisa told police Hall had been drinking for days and was becoming increasingly violent. The cops took Hall in for domestic battery. Lisa refused to press charges so ultimately, the charges were dropped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-lita>9) Lita</h2><p>Yes, you can add Lita, also known as Amy Christine Dumas, to the list of former arrested wrestlers. The popular Hall of Fame Diva was arrested in December of 2011 in Columbia County, Georgia, after being charged with speeding in excess of maximum limits and as if this wasn't bad enough, Lita was actually driving with a suspended or revoked licence. Stay tuned for more on a couple of wrestlers associated to Lita in the number 8 slot on this list.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-jeff-amp-matt-hardy>8) Jeff & Matt Hardy</h2><p>Both <a title="Jeff Hardy Net Worth" href=#>Jeff</a> and Matt have gotten in trouble with the law in the past. In 2009, Jeff was arrested and charged for trafficking controlled prescription pills and possession of anabolic steroids. Police found 262 vicodin pills, 180 soma pills, 555 milliliters of anabolic steroids, residual amounts of powdered cocaine and drug paraphernalia. Jeff would end up serving 10 days in prison for his violations. Brother Matt also spent some time in jail after a bloody brawl with wife Reby Sky. Matt was <a href=#>arrested in a motel</a> in Virginia after the two got into a physical altercation. Both were arrested and charged with assault and battery after an employee at the Hampton called 911. Both had noticeable scars and scratches in their mug shots following the incident.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-ric-flair>7) Ric Flair</h2><p>Many would probably not expect the one and only Ric Flair to appear on this list of wrestlers who have a criminal record. Well, many of you would be mistaken. Although not as bad as a few of the other entries on this list, an arrest was issued towards <a title="Ric Flair Net Worth" href=#>Ric Flair</a> after not paying his ex-wife more than $32,000 in spousal support which consisted of his spouse’s car lease and insurance and health insurance. Ric Flair’s failure to meet those deadlines required him to turn himself into police’s custody.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-big-show>6) Big Show</h2><p>Yet another great story on how a wrestler got arrested, <a title="Big Show Net Worth" href=#>Big Show's</a> arrest comes in at number 6 on our list of wrestlers who have a criminal record. This one took place in December of 1998, in Memphis, Tennessee. Although this story does not imply any criminality, it still deserves a spot on this list due to the actions taken. Big Show allegedly exposed himself to a female motel employee, and the employee proceeded to call the cops. After arresting the Big Show though, charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-chris-jericho>5) Chris Jericho</h2><p><a title="Chris Jericho Net Worth" href=#>Chris Jericho</a> and fellow wrestler Gregory Helms aka “the Hurricane” were found involved in a public, drunken brawl, which resulted in an arrest&nbsp;for <a href=#>public intoxication</a>, in January 2010. The two were found at a Shell gas station and both taken into Kenton County custody around 5:45 in the morning. Cops were called in after they received complaints of the two men fighting in a cab at a gas station in Crescent Springs. Luckily for the wrestling stars, both men were set free after paying $120 bond. Yes, $120.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-kurt-angle>4) Kurt Angle</h2><p><a title="Kurt Angle Net Worth" href=#>Kurt Angle's</a> had a pretty rough history when it comes to problems with the law. Angle was arrested in 2013 for yet another DWI, and this was Angle’s 4th alcohol-related arrest in the last 6 years. Angle entered rehab after his sixth arrest. In 2013, Angle was stopped by cops after police received phone calls about a reckless driver. The cops would later catch up to Kurt and bring him in for driving under the influence, once again. Angle was also arrested in 2007 for a DUI in Pennsylvania and also arrested twice in 2011, once for being drunk behind the wheel of a parked car and once for DWI. Since entering rehab, Angle has no further charges on his record.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-stone-cold-steve-austin>3) Stone Cold Steve Austin</h2><p>The Texas Rattlesnake found himself in some trouble while being married to ex-wife and former WWE Diva, Debra. On June 15th, 2002, things got heated between the <a href=#>former couple</a>, so much so that the police were called to their home&nbsp;in San Antonio. Debra was found bruised and hysterical by the police, while Austin had already fled the scene. On August 14th,&nbsp;Austin was arrested and charged with domestic abuse. <a title="Steve Austin Net Worth" href=#>Steve</a> plead no contest and was given 80 hours of community service, along with probation. Debra finally spoke out about the whole situation years later. She claimed that it was an act of “roid rage”, telling Fox news that Steve hit&nbsp;her 3 times and claimed the WWE put a “gag order” on her so she would not reveal the truth. WWE did not respond to her allegations. Austin filed for divorce July 22, 2002.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-shawn-michaels>2) Shawn Michaels</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To this very day, this story remains a huge question mark amongst many faithful HBK fans; why on earth did "The Heartbreak Kid" <a title="Shawn Michaels Net Worth" href=#>Shawn Michaels</a> get arrested? It is certainly a legitimate question though, as actual details regarding the incident were never made public till this very day. All we really know is that Shawn Michaels was arrested in Louisville, Kentucky and brought into Jefferson County Jail. The date and cause of the arrest were never made public.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-vince-mcmahon>1) Vince McMahon</h2><p>Despite not spending a full day behind bars, <a title="Vince McMahon Net Worth" href=#>Vince</a> was indicted by the federal government based on charges of distribution of <a href=#>illegal steroids</a> and drugs. The investigation began in December of 1989. The FBI closed in on Dr. George T. Zahorian III, the doctor that the FBI believed was distributing illegal steroids to wrestlers in the WWE at the time. Zahorian was later caught and sentenced to three years in federal prison. Later on, after the doctor's arrest, the FBI indicted Vince for operating an illegal steroid distribution ring. On November 18th, 1993, McMahon was charged with possession of steroids and conspiracy to distribute steroids. This sentence was enough to lock Vince up for 11 years and fine him $2 million, while seizing the Titan Towers (valued at over $9 million). Kevin Walcholz, aka “Nailz”, testified against Vince, claiming he&nbsp;encouraged wrestlers to use steroids. The prosecution’s case would end up falling apart after <a title="Hulk Hogan Net Worth" href=#>Hulk Hogan</a> (who was taken to&nbsp;the stand to testify against Vince) declared that he took steroids without Vince ever telling him a word about it. Vince would end up acquitted of&nbsp;all charges.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>bleacherreport.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>wrestlinginc.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>tmz.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>cagesideseats.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>chron.com,</a></p><p><a href=#>thesmokinggun.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>nytimes.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e5BuZLCvlWLAta3RrGSyp6Visaqwza1kpKafrHqprcNmmGabop66qrrApWSrnZOkv6V7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-wwe-stars-you-didnt-know-had-a-criminal-record.html&text=15%20WWE%20Stars%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20Had%20A%20Criminal%20Record&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-wwe-stars-you-didnt-know-had-a-criminal-record.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-wwe-stars-you-didnt-know-had-a-criminal-record.html&title=15%20WWE%20Stars%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20Had%20A%20Criminal%20Record" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-wwe-stars-you-didnt-know-had-a-criminal-record.html&title=15%20WWE%20Stars%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20Had%20A%20Criminal%20Record" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-wwe-stars-you-didnt-know-had-a-criminal-record.html&title=15%20WWE%20Stars%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20Had%20A%20Criminal%20Record" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-wwe-stars-you-didnt-know-had-a-criminal-record.html&description=15%20WWE%20Stars%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20Had%20A%20Criminal%20Record" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./16-of-the-most-overrated-celebrities.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="16 Of The Most Overrated Celebrities">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./15-parents-whose-ages-will-shock-you.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Parents Whose Ages Will Shock You">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
