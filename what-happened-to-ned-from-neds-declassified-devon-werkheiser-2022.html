While it didn't receive stellar ratings when it ran on Nickelodeon between 2004 and 2007, it had a dedicated cult fanbase and earned incredible reviews. The Los Angeles Times even claimed it was "one of the best" children's programs on TV. This seems to be the opinion of many of the show's fans to this date. Following Devon Werkheiser's Ned Bigby attempting to survive middle school was extremely entertaining, silly, and yet quite heartfelt. In theory, this should have set up all the cast members for incredible success. But<a href=#> almost all of them have seemingly vanished since</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans are particularly interested in <a href=#>what happened to Devon Werkheiser</a>. Unlike stars such as Victoria Justice, <a href=#>who has primarily focused on acting since her Nickelodeon days</a>, Devon almost entirely changed his life.

However, he did earn 7 episodes on the TV series Greek, have a guest-starring spot on Two Broke Girls, Franklin & Bash, American Dad, and Criminal Minds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also starred in a number of low-budget TV movies and indie films including Beneath The Darkness, Santa Girl, Break Night, Bad Sister, Where's The Money, and Crown Vic with director Joel Souza.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Former Nickelodeon Actors Who Live Life Off-Screen Now</a></span></p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Speech Bubble</a>, Devon claimed that he had to take acting classes again since the industry didn't see him as anything more than a Nickelodeon star.

According to his interview with Speech Bubble, he worked at the front desk at a L.A. Equinox gym as well as a bunch of other 'day jobs'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=devon-was-going-to-have-an-acting-comeback-in-alec-baldwin-39-s-rust><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Devon Was Going To Have An Acting Comeback In Alec Baldwin's Rust</span></h2><p>Because of his working relationship with Joel Souza in Crown Vic, Devon got the chance to audition for a role in the writer/director's now-canceled film Rust. Of course, Rust was shut down after the tragic accident on set that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed the life of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins</a>. In an interview with ABC News, Devon claimed he was excited to make the film with the acclaimed cast that included Alec Baldwin. He also stated that he was devastated when he found out the horrific news about Halyna. Devon was not on set at the time of the accident.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Video Of Alec Baldwin Immediately After ‘Rust’ Shooting Surfaces</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If you weren't on this movie, you can't possibly understand what this feels like," Devon said of the tragedy. "You can't know what it was like to be there on set before. And what it was to experience that day.

While he continued to take some acting jobs, the almost entirely changed his career path aiming it toward success in the music industry. Decon originally signed with Universal Motown but somehow ended up losing his record label.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I got signed by them like right after Ned’s Declassified," Devon said during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Conventional Relations in 2020</a>. "What was amazing was I was just learning guitar and singing and I didn’t know who I was as an artist at all. Universal sent me around LA for two years songwriting with like forty different producers and making demos. I learned so much during that time. It was epic. I just got into my skin as a songwriter and as an artist and I got this crash course in pop songwriting. We made some great songs that are still around, but eventually, they just weren’t going to make the record."</p><p>Still, Devon pursued his rock/pop music and continues to make it to this day.</p><h2 id=devon-werkheiser-released-his-own-music><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Devon Werkheiser Released His Own Music</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite not having a record label, Devon decided to release his own music with the help of artists Charlie Midnight, Wally Gagel, Eddie Galan, and Tim Myers. He managed to get himself booked at a number of venues and released his first single, "If Eyes Could Speak" in 2010. He starred in the music video with his then-girlfriend, Molly McCook.</p><p>Devon released his first EP in 2013, his second in 2016, and his third, "Chapter One" in 2020 which only contained 5 songs despite him having written over 45. Clearly, the talented artist only wants to put his best foot forward in the challenging industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=devon-39-s-band-opened-for-seal><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Devon's Band Opened For Seal</span></h2><p>"I’d been with a music manager for a little while and we partnered with Seal’s manager [in 2019]," Devon said during an interview with Conventional Relations in 2020. "The first time I talked to her she was like 'Yeah, we rep Seal and we have a little tour coming up this summer. We’re gonna get you on a couple shows'. Then literally like two weeks later she’s like 'Here are the dates.

He did this on the crowd-funding platform IndieGoGo for his third EP "Chapter One". It was successful but his music producer literally ghosted him during the process, according to Devon's interview with Conventional Relations. Still, he managed to get "Chapter One" out there.
