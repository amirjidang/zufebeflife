The show received so much backlash that they changed the way celebrities are booted from the show; they let the judges decide who goes home in between the two couples with the lowest combined score and fan votes. Let's take a look at which high-scoring and talented celebrities were voted off the show before the finale.</p><h2 id=sabrina-bryan-was-voted-off-dancing-with-the-stars><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sabrina Bryan Was Voted Off Dancing With the Stars</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sabrina Bryan, from the Cheetah Girls, who was partnered with Mark Ballas in season 5, was an incredible dancer that fans loved, however, she didn't receive enough votes one week and was booted off the show in 7th place during season 5, and again in 8th place during season 15. She was so beloved and fans were so disappointed when she left the show too early that they invited her back as a guest performer one week.</p><h2 id=melora-hardin-was-voted-off-dancing-with-the-stars><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Melora Hardin Was Voted Off Dancing With the Stars</span></h2><p>Definitely a fan favorite as well as a judge's favorite on season 30 of Dancing With the Stars, The Office and The Bold Type star, Melora Hardin, was voted off just before the finale. Her average score on the show was 36 out of 40, which is very good, especially considering she was in her 50s when she competed. She came in 6th place on the show and held a season-high score of a perfect 40 for her Paso Doble.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Many Dance Partners Became Couples On Dancing With the Stars?</a></span></p><h2 id=sunisa-lee-was-voted-off-dancing-with-the-stars><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sunisa Lee Was Voted Off Dancing With the Stars</span></h2><p>Olympic gold medal gymnast Sunisa Lee was voted off Dancing With the Stars in 5th place, just before the finale in season 30.

According to PopSugar, during a backstage interview, Lee said that "obviously <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">we didn't make it to the finale</a>, but I feel like I finally found myself, and I'm more confident in myself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brandy-norwood-was-voted-off-dancing-with-the-stars><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Brandy Norwood Was Voted Off Dancing With the Stars</span></h2><p>Brandy Norwood competed in season 11 of Dancing With the Stars and came in 4th place with her professional partner, Maksim, after being a front-runner to win all season.
