Film review aggregators predicted that his turn in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny would underperform, hence it was "destined" to bomb.</p><p>Ford has not been shy about discussing his biggest flops at the box office. Was he being forthright about the reasons they didn't progress further?</p><h2 id=is-harrison-ford-rsquo-s-indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-a-box-office-flop><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Is Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny A Box Office Flop?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-13.png><p>True film buffs know that Harrison Ford is solely responsible for Indiana Jones's enchantment on viewers. In fact, he was so committed to the role that <a href=# rel=nofollow>he filmed scenes in increments</a> due to injury pains on-set. It's too bad that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny might not do as well as he'd hoped at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was expected that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny would open to a disappointing $60 million in the United States.</p><p>According to Deadline, industry insiders anticipated that the fifth and final installment in the franchise would earn between $60 million and $70 million during its five-day holiday debut. With a reported budget of $295 million, this picture was the most expensive in the Indiana Jones franchise. MovieWeb claimed that the film would only earn around $160 million worldwide.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Harrison Ford Really Didn't Want Chris Pratt To Play Indiana Jones For This Completely Understandable Reason</a></span></p><p>While those are respectable statistics for any film, Disney and Lucasfilm were hoping that Harrison Ford's swan song as the archeological action hero would be a huge financial success. Additionally, tentpole movies of this nature have made their budget back in the first weekend. This includes the much-maligned Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull which was a box office smash-hit, despite being loathed by critics and hardcore fans alike.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny faired better in reviews, it seems to be a disappointment. And this is something that Ford himself may have foreseen, in a funny and honest way...</p><p>At the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">film's premiere in the United Kingdom</a>, Ford said that, despite his fondness for the role, he found the decision to keep him in it to be "kind of silly."</p><p>"I mean, it's kind of silly. It's 42 years we've been going on with this. But the reason for that, I think, is because these are family films, and they're passed on from generation to generation of young people when their parents feel it's the right time.”</p><p>Since Ford is 80 years old, continuing the series just for the sake of continuity could not bring in the biggest audiences. It makes sense that he would <a href=# rel=nofollow>give up on playing Indiana Jones again</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paranoia-is-harrison-ford-rsquo-s-biggest-box-office-flop><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Paranoia Is Harrison Ford’s Biggest Box Office Flop</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3-11.png><p>Harrison Ford co-starred with Gary Oldman and Liam Hemsworth in the picture Paranoia, although it's probably the film you know the least about.</p><p>Paranoia, despite having a stellar cast and a budget of $40 million, underperformed at the box office.

The film's first weekend gross was only $3.5 million, or $1,423 per theater.</p><p>That's not just Ford's worst wide opening weekend but one of the worst opening weekends ever for a movie in more than 2,000 cinemas.</p><p>On the other hand, Ford didn't appear too invested in the film's premise, to the point where he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">didn't want to be identified as himself</a>, suggesting that his heart wasn't entirely in it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He discussed this with the Los Angeles Daily News, saying, “What I wanted to do was not look like Harrison Ford,” he said of playing his character, Goddard. “Then people have this expectation about the character, they start watching for the Harrison Ford of it all, which is not very useful for the movie.”</p><h2 id=harrison-ford-rsquo-s-the-call-of-the-wild-lost-50-million-at-the-box-office><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Harrison Ford’s The Call of the Wild Lost $50 Million At The Box Office</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/4-12.png><p>A dog's tale starring Ford, The Call of the Wild, turned out to be a financial failure at the box office, costing millions to make.</p><p>The movie, which was adapted from Jack London's best-selling novel, earned $45 million in the United States and $79 million worldwide in its first two weeks of release.

With a reported budget of $100 million, K-19: The Widowmaker was a massive financial failure.</p><p>What moviegoer wouldn't want to watch Harrison Ford in a submarine? Well, evidently, a lot of people, especially internationally, as the film struggled to cross the $2 million mark in all markets except Spain and Japan, where it earned $2.7 million and $9.8 million, respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The man was rather pleased with his performance in the picture, despite its financial failure, because he was paid $25 million for only 20 days of work.</p><p>He told THR in 2023, "I'm proud of K-19: The Widowmaker, where I played a Russian submarine captain.

Even though The Mosquito Coast was a box office bomb that only a select few people saw, Ford found great inspiration in the role.</p><p>Ford has made frequent references to The Mosquito Coast during his career. According to an interview he gave to Entertainment Weekly in 1992:</p><p>"It's the only film I have done that hasn't made its money back. I'm still glad I did it. If there was a fault with the film, it was that it didn't fully enough embrace the language of the book. It may have more properly been a literary rather than a cinematic exercise.

After failing to earn $100 million in the United States, Alcon Entertainment may have lost as much as $80 million on the film.</p><p>Blade Runner 2049 may have bombed at the box office, but its neon-drenched atmosphere has quickly established an iconic vibe in modern filmmaking, and the picture earned Oscars for cinematography and visual effects.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Sean Young Said She Was Purposely Put In An Aggressive Scene With Harrison Ford As A Punishment For Not Dating The Director</a></span></p><p>Ford told The Globe and Daily Mail that he thought Blade Runner 2049 would have an instantaneous resonance with viewers rather than the incremental appreciation of the original film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“These are existential questions, which the movie really doesn’t stop to ponder.
