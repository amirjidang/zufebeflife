At twelve, he was competing nationally, catching the eye of bigger brands.</p><p>This early success fueled his passion, leading him to drop out of high school at 16, and chase his dream of skateboarding in Mecca, Southern California.</p><p>There, he turned pro in 1991, competing internationally and landing a coveted sponsorship with Alien Workshop, a company that would produce his signature skateboards. Dyrdek's entrepreneurial spirit blossomed alongside his skating skills.</p><p>He founded Orion Trucks, a skateboard accessory company, at the young age of 17.
