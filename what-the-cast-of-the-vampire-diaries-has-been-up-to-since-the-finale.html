That’s why it made so much sense for <strong><a href=#>The Vampire Diaries</a></strong>&nbsp;to premiere on The CW Network! TVD ran from 2009 to 2017 for eight seasons focusing on low triangles, action sequences, bloodthirst, eternal life, relationship turmoil, friendship loyalty, and a lot more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Did Nina Dobrev Really Like Playing Elena On ‘The Vampire Diaries’?</a></span></p><p class=p1>The show is classified as a drama, fantasy, and horror show although it doesn’t push the boundaries of being too scary. Here’s what the cast of the show has been up to since the show ended.</p><h2 id=ian-somerhalder><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ian Somerhalder</span></h2><p class=p1>Love and marriage happened for <a href=#>Ian Somerhalder</a> before his time on TVD came to an end. He married his wife, Nikki Reed, in 2015 which was two years before TVD concluded. They welcomed their first child into the world together in 2017:&nbsp;Bodhi Soleil Reed Somerhalder.&nbsp;It is special to watch their family growing and expanding. In 2019, he landed the leading role in another vampire TV series called V Wars. The sci-fi show only ran for one season despite the fact that Ian Somerhalder was doing a great job leading the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nina-dobrev><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Nina Dobrev</span></h2><p class=p1>Everyone knows that <a href=#>Nina Dobrev</a> parted ways with TVD before the show actually came to an end but she was such a pivotal part of the series that she is still considered one of the biggest names from the show. It was sad to see her leave the show and not finish things out until the very end but she had&nbsp;valid&nbsp;reasons. Mainly the fact that she used to date&nbsp;Ian Somerhalder&nbsp;and then he started dating Nikki Reed.&nbsp;It is really hard to work on set with an ex-boyfriend. She has been dating an Olympic snowboarder name Shaun White and she landed roles in movies like Dog Days and Then Came You in recent years.</p><h2 id=paul-wesley><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Paul Wesley</span></h2><p class=p1>The role of Stefan Salvatore was played by Paul Wesley flawlessly on TVD.&nbsp;He is an incredible actor who has even tried his hand at directing and working behind the scenes instead of always being the actor handling business in front of the camera. Since 2019 he has been happily married to <a href=#>his wife Ines de Ramon</a> and the two seem to be doing just fine without having any kids just yet. Since TVD, he starred in a show called Tell Me a Story between 2018 and 2020. The dark series is set in New York City and focuses on the subjects of revenge and greed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=candice-king><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Candice King</span></h2><p class=p1>The character of Caroline Forbes was played by the beautiful blonde bombshell, Candice King. She has been married for quite some time and tied the knot before her time on TVD came to an end. Her wedding took place in 2014 and she married <a href=#>her husband, Joe King</a>. They have two children together and they&nbsp;visibly appear to be one big happy family! According to her Instagram where she has over 8.6 million followers, she loves posting pretty solo selfies, pictures of her kids, pictures of her dog, and pictures with her friends.</p><h2 id=kat-graham><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kat Graham</span></h2><p class=p1>It’s hard not to love someone as talented and beautiful as <a href=#>Kat Graham</a>! She is so much more than your typical actress. She is also an artist, dancer, producer, and according to her Instagram, she is a Goodwill Ambassador for refugees of Ethiopia. Taking a scroll through her Instagram page will reveal just how much of a model she really is even though she doesn’t list herself as a model on her bio. She knows how to pose for a photoshoot in the most classy ways. Plus, she has done a couple of really cute holiday movies for Netflix in recent years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zach-roerig><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Zach Roerig</span></h2><p class=p1>Zach Roerig plays the character of Matt Donovan on TVD.

McQueen</span></h2><p class=p1>Steven R. McQueen ones played the role of Elena Gilbert’s younger brother, Jeremy Gilbert. The character he played on the show was easy to love and easy to root for! Since TVD came to an end, he has done a wide range of acting from movies like Home by Spring which is a total romance to shows like Medal of Horror which is a documentary series based on the militia. His fans hope to see more from him coming up soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-davis><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Matthew Davis</span></h2><p class=p1>Before we saw Matthew Davis starring in TVD, we saw him starting in Legally Blonde alongside Reese Witherspoon in the early 2000s!

He has around 2 million followers on Instagram and he posts pictures of himself going on wild adventures like skydiving, snowboarding, motorcycle riding, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=claire-holt><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Claire Holt</span></h2><p class=p1>Watching Claire Holt on TVD was always a lot of fun because she is such a beauty.
