She initially became popular due to her marriage with the ace comedian – Kevin Hart, but she has since made a name for herself in the entertainment industry as one of the forces to be reckoned with especially when it comes to girl-power and female independence.</p><p>Torrei’s life almost exploded into an impossible scandal when news and rumors of her husband cheating on her became the property of the public domain. The fact that she has been able to continue making a name for herself after the scandal, on her own terms, is something that has endeared her to even more people, who continue to remain curious about her journey. Read more about Torrei Hart below.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=torrei-harts-early-life-and-background></span><strong>Torrei Hart’s Early Life and Background</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She was born Torrei Skipper on the 28th of February 1978 in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was raised in the southern part of New Jersey by her close-knit family who went all out to make her childhood memories.</p><p>Torrei was interested in acting from a very young age. Her natural flair for the craft was obvious from her bubbly personality. She began her training from a tender age and by the time she became a teenager, she was already impressing her school mates. As she acted in numerous school plays and her performances were noted to be exceptional. She then graduated from high school in 1996.</p><p>To further her education, she got admitted to the Community College of Philadelphia where she met Kevin Hart. After the pair moved to Los Angeles and got married in 2003, a lot of Torrei Hart’s early career days were entwined with that of Kevin Hart.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=torrei-and-kevin-hart-were-college-sweethearts-before-they-got-married></span><strong>Torrei and Kevin Hart were college sweethearts before they got married</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Torrei Hart and the man she would grow to call her husband were college sweethearts. Torrei and Kevin Hart both left school to pursue a career in entertainment and got married several years later. Some would say that what they had was true love and that it looked like they would stay together forever. It certainly seemed that way when they had their first child, Heaven Leigh, on the 14th of March 2005 and their second child, Hendrix, on the 18th of February 2008.</p><p>Their marriage hit the rocks amidst cheating rumours that are often referenced even long after their split, and they finally got a divorce on the 13th of November 2011. The end of their marriage also heralded a change in Torrei’s career. Their two children were now a bit older freeing up her time and energy to focus on herself and her career which yielded positive results.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-she-supported-kevin-harts-career></span><strong>How She Supported Kevin Hart’s Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As Kevin’s career began to blossom, Torrei had to stay at home to take care of the family they were building. While she didn’t entirely give up on her career, it had to take a back seat while she played wife and mother to her two children. During this period she was still able to get some highly coveted jobs. She got a national commercial for Toyota and Ebay. She also starred in various films like Soul Plane where she starred alongside Kevin – her then-husband. She got a recurring role in Parental Discretion on Nickelodeon as well.</p><p>Torrei Hart got her big break in 2012 when she launched her YouTube comedy channel which she named “PrettyFunnyFish”. She got serious about the page hiring a team for production, and she released the product of their work online. It soon grew to be quite the hit online with more and more people watching her brand of comedy. Due to the popularity, she was able to garner from Pretty Funny Fish, Russell Simmons signed a production partnership with her to create online content that is unique for “All Def Digital. Moreover, the short film Victim of Circumstance which she co-wrote and starred in was very well received. It has won numerous awards and created quite in buzz in the short film circuit. Considering that she was also the executive producer of the film, a lot of the praise for it goes deservedly to her and her successes in these two projects were proof that she still retained her comedic talent and had an eye and flair for making people laugh.</p><p>Beyond her career and projects in the world of comedy and film, Torrei is not shy about sharing her journey and story. She has taken deliberate steps towards women empowerment and she and her sister launched a non-profit initiative (S.O.A.R) to help women overcome adversity.</p><p>Torrei Hart is also an entrepreneur and a healthy living advocate. She created her own low-sugar and low-calorie&nbsp;cocktail teaming up with ‘Skimpy Mixers’.</p><p>In August 2014, she joined the reality television show “Atlanta Exes” where she starred alongside Monyetta Shaw, Christina Johnson, Sheree Buchanan and Tameka Raymond. She has also featured in movies like American Bad Boy (2015), But Deliver us from Evil (2016) to mention a few. She is currently working on her own television project and has released a self-help book for women.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span><strong>Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Torrei is hard working and has been involved in quite a number of businesses during and after her marriage. She is an actress, writer, television personality and creates different contents on YouTube especially those aimed at empowering women. She also has a hair care line which she recently launched. As a result, her net worth has been estimated to be $3 million.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that Kevin Hart refused to pay her spousal support after their divorce as he claims that Torrei makes more than enough to support her self. She got a paltry sum of $175,000 from him besides the child support he pays every month.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=torrei-harts-height></span><strong>Torrei Hart’s Height</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Torrei Hart was married to a man who constantly makes jokes about his height.
