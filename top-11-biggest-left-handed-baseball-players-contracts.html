Though they are largely the minority, in face-to-face sports, lefties tend to hold the advantage over their opponent. If you consider that left-handed athletes have faced right-handed athletes more than vice versa, it provides reasoning as to why most athletes struggle against lefties.&nbsp;Hockey is the biggest exception to the rule, as there are far more left handed players than right handed players. For some reason, Canadians and European players are more prone to shoot left while Americans have a tendency to shoot right.</p><p>There are currently no starting quarterbacks in the National Football League with one possible exception being if <a title="Michael Vick Net Worth" href=#>Michael Vick</a> beats out <a title="Geno Smith Net Worth" href=#>Geno Smith</a> for the New York Jets' starting position. However, baseball, like boxing, is a sport where lefties have a history of dominance. Baseball owners will often pay inflated prices to keep a decent southpaw in their bullpen while opposing managers must alter their batting line-up to cater to a lefty on the mound. While it's no surprise to see the top three richest franchises account for 80% of our list, the Dodgers in particular seem to have a thing for expensive left-handed players. In order to make the cut, players must both bat and throw with their left hand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Mike Trout's 6-year, $144.5 million contract extension with the Angels and <a title="Miguel Cabrera Net Worth" href=#>Miguel Cabrera</a>'s 8-year, $248 million contract extension with the Detroit Tigers, Major League Baseball's opening week talk is all about cash flow.
